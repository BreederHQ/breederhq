## 💰 Add-Ons (For Pro Users)

Purpose: Let Pro users scale specific features without jumping to Enterprise

| Add-On | Price | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **+10 Animal Slots** | $5/month | Hit 50 limit, need 60 animals |
| **+1 Marketplace Listing** | $10/month | Want to list multiple breeding programs |
| **+10 Portal Users** | $5/month | Large waitlist, need more client access |
| **+10GB Storage** | $5/month | Heavy document/photo usage |
| **Priority Support** | $25/month | Need faster response without Enterprise |

**Why Add-ons:**
* User has 55 animals → Cheaper to buy +10 slots ($5) than upgrade to Enterprise ($60 more)
* Revenue optimization: User pays $44/mo instead of churning
* Upsell path to Enterprise when add-ons cost > $60/mo

## 🏪 Marketplace Listing Breakdown

### What's a "Marketplace Listing"?

A **marketplace listing** = 1 breeding program/operation profile visible on `marketplace.breederhq.com`

**Example:**
* "Golden Gate Labradors" = 1 listing
* "Golden Gate Poodles" = 2nd listing (would need add-on)

### What's Included in Each Listing:
* ✅ Program profile page
* ✅ About/bio section
* ✅ Photo gallery (up to 25 photos)
* ✅ Featured animals (show your breeding stock)
* ✅ Upcoming litters
* ✅ Waitlist signup form
* ✅ Contact form
* ✅ Reviews/testimonials
* ✅ Social media links

### Listing Quota Per Tier:

| Tier | Listings | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Trial** | 1 | Can preview marketplace during trial |
| **Pro** | 1 | Good for single-breed operations |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | Multi-breed programs, franchises |
| **Service Providers** | 1 free (Year 1) | Vets, trainers, photographers |

### Non-Breeder Service Provider Listings:

**Who:** Vets, trainers, photographers, groomers, transport services

**Pricing (Future - Year 2+):**

**Year 1:** FREE for everyone (build marketplace traffic)

**Year 2+:**
* **Basic Listing:** FREE (limited visibility, 5 photos)
* **Premium Listing:** $20/month (featured placement, unlimited photos, analytics)
* **Enterprise:** $50/month (top placement, lead tracking, CRM integration)

**Revenue Model:**
* Commission on bookings (if we facilitate transactions)
* OR flat listing fee (simpler to start)

## 🤝 Referral/Affiliate Program (All Tiers)

### How It Works:

1. **Every paying subscriber gets a referral code**
   * Example: `GOLDENGATELABS` or `BREEDER-AG8F3`

2. **Referrer (existing customer) shares code**
   * "Use my code GOLDENGATELABS for 20% off your first 3 months!"

3. **Referee (new customer) signs up with code**
   * Gets 20% discount on Pro plan: $39 → $31.20/month for 3 months
   * Saves $23.40 total

4. **Referrer gets reward**
   * Option A: $20 credit (1 month ~half off)
   * Option B: 20% off their next month
   * Option C: $20 cash via PayPal (if they request payout)

### Limits:
* No cap on referrals per user
* Credits stack (refer 5 users = $100 credit = 2.5 months free)
* Credits apply automatically to next invoice

### Referral Dashboard:
```
- Total referrals: 8
- Active referrals (still paying): 6
- Lifetime earnings: $120 in credits
- Available balance: $40
```

### Why This Works:
* Breeders know other breeders (tight community)
* Word-of-mouth is strongest marketing for this market
* 20% discount is significant ($23 savings) but doesn't kill margins
* Your cost: $11.70 per referee (your share of discount) + $20 referrer credit = $31.70 customer acquisition cost
* If customer stays 12+ months = $468 LTV vs $32 CAC = **14.6x ROI** 🚀

## 🚦 Quota Enforcement Behaviors

### At Limit (50/50 animals):

**UI:** "Add Animal" button shows badge: "50/50 - Upgrade"

**Click:** Modal appears
* → "You've reached your animal limit"
* → Show current usage bar (50/50)
* → **Options:**
  * [Upgrade to Enterprise - $99/mo] (primary CTA)
  * [Buy +10 Slots - $5/mo] (secondary)
  * [Archive an animal] (tertiary)

### Approaching Limit (45/50 animals):

**UI:** Banner at top of Animals page
* → "You're using 45 of 50 animals. Upgrade to add unlimited animals."
* → [Upgrade] button
* → [Dismiss] (can dismiss, shows again at 48/50)

### Over Limit During Trial → Paid Conversion:

**Scenario:** User adds 60 animals during 14-day trial

Trial ends → Subscription converts to Pro

System detects: 60 animals > 50 limit

**Options:**

**Option 1 (RECOMMENDED):** Grace period: 7 days to either:
* Archive 10 animals
* Upgrade to Enterprise
* Buy +10 slots add-on

**Option 2:** Hard cutoff: Cannot add more animals until compliant
* Can still view/edit existing 60
* Cannot create new until under 50

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (grace period) - better UX

### Marketplace Listing Limit:

**Pro User with 1 listing:**
* → "Create Listing" button disabled
* → Tooltip: "Upgrade to Enterprise for unlimited listings or buy an add-on"
* → Click: Modal with upgrade options

**Enterprise User:**
* → No limits, create as many as needed

## 💡 Pricing Psychology

### Why $39 for Pro?
* Below psychological $50 threshold
* Annual = $390 (saves $78, 16.7% discount)
* Positions as "affordable professional tool"

### Why $99 for Enterprise?
* 2.5x Pro price = clear value jump
* Still under $100/mo psychological barrier
* Annual = $990 (saves $198, 16.7% discount)

### Annual Discount Strategy:
* 2 months free (16.7% off) = strong incentive
* Upfront cash = better cash flow
* Higher LTV, lower churn (12-month commitment)

### Add-on Pricing Strategy:
* $5 increments (feels small)
* Forces upgrade decision when add-ons > $20/mo
* Example: User with +20 animals ($10) + +1 listing ($10) = $59/mo → should just pay $99 for Enterprise

## ❓ Open Questions for Decision

### 1. Trial Limit Enforcement:
* Should trial users have same 50 animal limit, or unlimited during trial?
* **Recommendation:** 50 limit during trial (tests real-world usage)

### 2. Storage Quota:
* How much storage (GB) per tier?
* **Suggested:** Pro = 50GB, Enterprise = 500GB
* **Price add-on:** +10GB = $5/mo

### 3. Staff Members:
* Currently unlimited for both tiers - correct?
* **Or should:** Pro = 5 staff, Enterprise = unlimited?

### 4. Service Provider Listings:
* Should they be separate from breeder subscriptions entirely?
* Or can a service provider also be a breeder (dual account)?

### 5. Marketplace Commission:
* Are we charging commission on marketplace sales NOW?
* Or just limiting listing count for now (no payment processing yet)?
