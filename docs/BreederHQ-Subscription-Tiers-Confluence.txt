h2. 💰 Add-Ons (For Pro Users)

Purpose: Let Pro users scale specific features without jumping to Enterprise

|| Add-On || Price || Use Case ||
| *+10 Animal Slots* | $5/month | Hit 50 limit, need 60 animals |
| *+1 Marketplace Listing* | $10/month | Want to list multiple breeding programs |
| *+10 Portal Users* | $5/month | Large waitlist, need more client access |
| *+10GB Storage* | $5/month | Heavy document/photo usage |
| *Priority Support* | $25/month | Need faster response without Enterprise |

*Why Add-ons:*
* User has 55 animals → Cheaper to buy +10 slots ($5) than upgrade to Enterprise ($60 more)
* Revenue optimization: User pays $44/mo instead of churning
* Upsell path to Enterprise when add-ons cost > $60/mo

----

h2. 🏪 Marketplace Listing Breakdown

h3. What's a "Marketplace Listing"?

A *marketplace listing* = 1 breeding program/operation profile visible on {{marketplace.breederhq.com}}

*Example:*
* "Golden Gate Labradors" = 1 listing
* "Golden Gate Poodles" = 2nd listing (would need add-on)

h3. What's Included in Each Listing:
* (/) Program profile page
* (/) About/bio section
* (/) Photo gallery (up to 25 photos)
* (/) Featured animals (show your breeding stock)
* (/) Upcoming litters
* (/) Waitlist signup form
* (/) Contact form
* (/) Reviews/testimonials
* (/) Social media links

h3. Listing Quota Per Tier:

|| Tier || Listings || Notes ||
| *Trial* | 1 | Can preview marketplace during trial |
| *Pro* | 1 | Good for single-breed operations |
| *Enterprise* | Unlimited | Multi-breed programs, franchises |
| *Service Providers* | 1 free (Year 1) | Vets, trainers, photographers |

h3. Non-Breeder Service Provider Listings:

*Who:* Vets, trainers, photographers, groomers, transport services

*Pricing (Future - Year 2+):*

*Year 1:* FREE for everyone (build marketplace traffic)

*Year 2+:*
* *Basic Listing:* FREE (limited visibility, 5 photos)
* *Premium Listing:* $20/month (featured placement, unlimited photos, analytics)

*Revenue Model:*
* Commission on bookings (if we facilitate transactions)
* OR flat listing fee (simpler to start)

----

h2. 🤝 Referral/Affiliate Program (All Tiers)

h3. How It Works:

# *Every paying subscriber gets a referral code*
* Example: {{GOLDENGATELABS}} or {{BREEDER-AG8F3}}

# *Referrer (existing customer) shares code*
* "Use my code GOLDENGATELABS for 20% off your first 3 months!"

# *Referee (new customer) signs up with code*
* Gets 20% discount on Pro plan: $39 → $31.20/month for 3 months
* Saves $23.40 total

# *Referrer gets reward*
* Option A: $20 credit (1 month ~half off)
* Option B: 20% off their next month
* Option C: $20 cash via PayPal (if they request payout)

h3. Limits:
* No cap on referrals per user
* Credits stack (refer 5 users = $100 credit = 2.5 months free)
* Credits apply automatically to next invoice

h3. Referral Dashboard:
{code}
- Total referrals: 8
- Active referrals (still paying): 6
- Lifetime earnings: $120 in credits
- Available balance: $40
{code}

h3. Why This Works:
* Breeders know other breeders (tight community)
* Word-of-mouth is strongest marketing for this market
* 20% discount is significant ($23 savings) but doesn't kill margins
* Your cost: $11.70 per referee (your share of discount) + $20 referrer credit = $31.70 customer acquisition cost
* If customer stays 12+ months = $468 LTV vs $32 CAC = *14.6x ROI* 🚀

h2. 🚦 Quota Enforcement Behaviors

h3. At Limit (50/50 animals):

*UI:* "Add Animal" button shows badge: "50/50 - Upgrade"

*Click:* Modal appears
* → "You've reached your animal limit"
* → Show current usage bar (50/50)
* → *Options:*
** \[Upgrade to Enterprise - $99/mo\] (primary CTA)
** \[Buy +10 Slots - $5/mo\] (secondary)
** \[Archive an animal\] (tertiary)

h3. Approaching Limit (45/50 animals):

*UI:* Banner at top of Animals page
* → "You're using 45 of 50 animals. Upgrade to add unlimited animals."
* → \[Upgrade\] button
* → \[Dismiss\] (can dismiss, shows again at 48/50)

h3. Over Limit During Trial → Paid Conversion:

*Scenario:* User adds 60 animals during 14-day trial

Trial ends → Subscription converts to Pro

System detects: 60 animals > 50 limit

*Options:*

*Option 1 (RECOMMENDED):* Grace period: 7 days to either:
* Archive 10 animals
* Upgrade to Enterprise
* Buy +10 slots add-on

*Option 2:* Hard cutoff: Cannot add more animals until compliant
* Can still view/edit existing 60
* Cannot create new until under 50

{info}*Recommendation:* Option 1 (grace period) - better UX{info}

h3. Marketplace Listing Limit:

*Pro User with 1 listing:*
* → "Create Listing" button disabled
* → Tooltip: "Upgrade to Enterprise for unlimited listings or buy an add-on"
* → Click: Modal with upgrade options

*Enterprise User:*
* → No limits, create as many as needed

h2. 💡 Pricing Psychology

h3. Why $39 for Pro?
* Below psychological $50 threshold
* Annual = $390 (saves $78, 16.7% discount)
* Positions as "affordable professional tool"

h3. Why $99 for Enterprise?
* 2.5x Pro price = clear value jump
* Still under $100/mo psychological barrier
* Annual = $990 (saves $198, 16.7% discount)

h3. Annual Discount Strategy:
* 2 months free (16.7% off) = strong incentive
* Upfront cash = better cash flow
* Higher LTV, lower churn (12-month commitment)

h3. Add-on Pricing Strategy:
* $5 increments (feels small)
* Forces upgrade decision when add-ons > $20/mo
* Example: User with +20 animals ($10) + +1 listing ($10) = $59/mo → should just pay $99 for Enterprise

h2. ❓ Open Questions for Decision

h3. 1. Trial Limit Enforcement:

* *Recommendation:* 50 limit during trial (tests real-world usage)

h3. 2. Storage Quota:
* How much storage (GB) per tier?
* *Suggested:* Pro = 50GB, Enterprise = 500GB
* *Price add-on:* +10GB = $5/mo

h3. 3. Staff Members:
* Currently unlimited for both tiers - correct?
* *Or should:* Pro = 5 staff, Enterprise = unlimited?

h3. 4. Service Provider Listings:
* Should they be separate from breeder subscriptions entirely?
* Or can a service provider also be a breeder (dual account)?

h3. 5. Marketplace Commission:
* Are we charging commission on marketplace sales NOW?
* Or just limiting listing count for now (no payment processing yet)?
