## Problem Section

### Header
```
You started breeding because you love the animals.
Now you're drowning in spreadsheets.
```

### Problem 1
**Title:** Spreadsheets break
**Description:** At 10+ animals, manual tracking becomes a full-time job. Formulas break. Files get lost. You become the database.

### Problem 2
**Title:** Missed windows cost litters
**Description:** One forgotten heat cycle means months of waiting. One miscalculated date means a missed breeding. The math matters.

### Problem 3
**Title:** Buyers expect professionalism
**Description:** Today's buyers want updates, photos, health records, and clear communication. Scrambling through texts and emails doesn't cut it.

# DOG BREEDING PAGE (/dogs)

## Section 1: What This Page Is About

### Headline
```
Dog Breeding Software for Serious Breeders
```

### Body
```
Managing a dog breeding program means tracking cycles, planning breedings, managing genetics, communicating with buyers, and running a business—all while caring for animals that depend on you for everything.

This page explains when software helps and when it doesn't.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
The moment when hobby becomes chaos
```

### Body
```
Most breeders hit a wall somewhere between 5 and 15 dogs. The signs are predictable:

• Multiple breeding females with overlapping cycles
• A waitlist longer than you can hold in your head
• Health testing records scattered across emails and files
• Buyers asking questions you've already answered three times
• Invoices disconnected from the animals they're for
• That creeping feeling you're forgetting something important

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. And you're not failing—you've just outgrown your current system.
```

---

## Section 3: How Breeders Usually Handle It

### Headline
```
The tools breeders start with
```

### Body
```
Spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Excel)
One for animals, one for litters, one for contacts. Formulas that break when you add a row. No connection between sheets. Hours spent on data entry that should be automatic.

Notebooks and wall calendars
Heat dates circled in red. Notes that only you can decipher. Lost when you need them most. No backup if the notebook gets wet or the dog eats it.

Memory and hope
"I think she was in heat around Thanksgiving." "I'm pretty sure I told them about the deposit." "I know I wrote that down somewhere."

Facebook groups and text messages
Buyer communication scattered across platforms. No record of what you promised. Scrolling through months of messages to find one detail.

These tools work. Until they don't.
```

---

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why spreadsheets fail for dog breeders
```

### Body
```
Dog-specific biology creates complexity that generic tools can't handle:

Reproductive cycles
• Estrus cycles every 6-7 months (varies by individual and breed)
• 63-day gestation with critical developmental windows
• Progesterone testing timing determines breeding success
• Split heats, silent heats, and irregular cycles happen
• Puppy socialization windows (3-12 weeks) are non-negotiable

Health testing requirements
• OFA hips and elbows (timing requirements by breed)
• PennHIP evaluations
• Breed-specific genetic panels (different for every breed)
• Eye certifications (annual renewal required)
• Cardiac clearances
• DNA profiles

What spreadsheets can't do:
• Calculate next expected heat from historical data
• Remind you when progesterone testing should start
• Connect a breeding to its resulting litter automatically
• Show you which females will have overlapping litters
• Let buyers see their puppy's progress
• Generate an invoice linked to a specific puppy
• Warn you when a health certification is expiring

A spreadsheet can store data. It cannot think for you. And when you're managing multiple litters, juggling waitlists, and trying to give every dog the attention they deserve, you need a system that thinks.
```

## Section 5: What a Correct System Looks Like

### Headline
```
The system serious dog breeders need
```

### Body
```
This isn't about BreederHQ specifically. This is what any proper breeding management system must do:

Animal Management
• Every dog with complete records in one place
• Pedigree visible to any depth needed
• Health testing results attached to the animal (not in a separate file)
• Titles and competition history tracked
• Photos that stay organized and connected
• Ownership and co-ownership properly recorded

Breeding Operations
• Cycle history per female with pattern recognition
• Breeding calendar showing all females at once
• Automatic date calculations (expected heat, whelping, weaning, placement)
• Genetics tracking for coat color and health markers
• Collision detection when litters will overlap
• Stud service tracking for outside breedings

Client Management
• Every contact and their history in one place
• Communication log (not scattered across platforms)
• Waitlist with position, preferences, and deposits
• Contracts and agreements stored and accessible
• Notes that don't get lost

Business Operations
• Invoicing connected to specific puppies
• Payment tracking without separate accounting software
• Deposit management that doesn't require a spreadsheet
• Expense tracking for tax time

Buyer Experience
• A way for buyers to see their puppy's progress
• Access to health testing documentation
• Communication that doesn't require you to repeat yourself
• Professional presentation that builds trust
```

## Section 6: How BreederHQ Supports This

### Headline
```
BreederHQ was built for this
```

### Body
```
Dog-specific cycle calculations that account for individual variation. Pedigree tracking with genetic health markers. A breeding calendar that shows you what's coming before it arrives. Waitlist management that doesn't require a separate spreadsheet. Buyer portals so you stop answering the same questions. Invoicing that connects to the actual puppy.

All of it connected. None of it requiring you to become a database administrator.

## Section 7: Who This Is For

### Headline
```
BreederHQ is built for dog breeders who:
```

### Body
```
• Have 5+ dogs (or plan to get there)
• Produce regular litters (not one-time accidents)
• Do health testing and want to track it properly
• Have a waitlist they're tired of managing manually
• Want buyers to see them as professional
• Are spending more time on admin than they want to
• Value their time at more than $0/hour
```

---

## Section 8: Who This Is Not For

### Headline
```
BreederHQ is probably not for you if:
```

### Body
```
• You have 1-2 dogs and no plans to grow
• You had one accidental litter and won't have more
• You prefer paper records and that's working for you
• You're not doing health testing
• You don't have a waitlist to manage

There's no shame in any of these. Software isn't always the answer. If a notebook works, use the notebook. If a spreadsheet handles everything you need, keep the spreadsheet.

BreederHQ exists for the moment when those tools stop working.
```

## Section 9: FAQ

### Headline
```
Questions dog breeders ask
```

### Q1
**Question:** Can I import my existing pedigrees?
**Answer:** Yes. You can enter historical data and connect generations. There's no limit on pedigree depth. If you have records going back 20 generations, you can enter all of it.

### Q2
**Question:** Does it handle co-owned dogs?
**Answer:** Yes. Ownership can be shared and tracked. Co-owners can have appropriate access levels.

### Q3
**Question:** Can buyers see health testing results?
**Answer:** Yes. The buyer portal shows what you choose to share. You control visibility.

### Q4
**Question:** What if I breed multiple breeds?
**Answer:** No problem. Animals are organized however you want. Many breeders work with multiple breeds.

### Q5
**Question:** Does it integrate with AKC or UKC?
**Answer:** BreederHQ tracks registration numbers and information. It doesn't submit to registries directly—you'll still use their systems for official registration.

### Q6
**Question:** Can I track progesterone testing?
**Answer:** Yes. Results can be logged with dates and values, helping you see patterns over time.

### Q7
**Question:** What about stud services?
**Answer:** Whether you're using outside studs or standing your own males at stud, the system tracks it.

### Q8
**Question:** Can I try it before paying?
**Answer:** Yes. 14-day free trial with full access. No credit card required to start.

# CAT BREEDING PAGE (/cats)

## Section 1: What This Page Is About

### Headline
```
Cat Breeding Software Built for Catteries
```

### Body
```
Cat breeding has unique challenges that dog-focused software misses entirely. Induced ovulation changes everything about timing. Queens can cycle repeatedly when not bred. Multiple breeds have specific genetic concerns that require careful tracking.

This page is for cat breeders specifically.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
When cattery management gets complicated
```

### Body
```
Most catteries hit a complexity wall around 5-10 cats. The signs:

• Multiple queens cycling simultaneously
• Genetic tracking for breed-specific concerns (HCM, PKD, PRA)
• Kitten placements overlapping with new litters
• TICA or CFA registration requirements
• Buyers expecting health guarantees with documentation
• Stud management and outside breeding coordination

Sound familiar? You're not disorganized. You've just outgrown basic tools.
```

---

## Section 3: How Breeders Usually Handle It

### Headline
```
The tools catteries start with
```

### Body
```
Spreadsheets with color codes
One sheet for queens, one for studs, one for litters, one for contacts. Color-coded cells that only make sense to you. Formulas that break mysteriously.

Paper files and photo folders
Registration papers in one drawer. Health records in another. Photos scattered across phone, computer, and cloud storage. Nothing connected.

Memory
"I think she was bred around the 15th." "I'm pretty sure that kitten is reserved." "I know I sent them the contract."

Text messages everywhere
Buyer conversations in iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Instagram DMs, email, and occasionally actual phone calls. Good luck finding anything.
```

---

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why cat breeding requires different tools
```

### Body
```
Cat-specific biology:

Induced ovulation
Cats only ovulate when bred. This fundamentally changes timing calculations compared to dogs. Queens that aren't bred can cycle repeatedly—every 2-3 weeks during breeding season. This creates both opportunities and management challenges.

Gestation and development
• 63-65 day gestation
• Kittens ready for placement at 12-16 weeks (varies by breed and cattery policy)
• Socialization windows that affect lifetime temperament

Health testing complexity
• HCM screening (echocardiogram, often annual)
• PKD DNA testing (especially Persians and related breeds)
• PRA and other breed-specific genetic panels
• FeLV/FIV status
• Blood type for breeding compatibility

What generic tools miss:
• Induced ovulation timing calculations
• Repeated cycling patterns when not bred
• Breed-specific genetic concern tracking
• Blood type compatibility checking
• TICA/CFA registration workflows
```

---

## Section 5: What a Correct System Looks Like

### Headline
```
The system serious catteries need
```

### Body

• Photos organized by cat and date

Breeding Management
• Queen cycle tracking with induced ovulation logic
• Breeding dates with expected due date calculation
• Kitten count and development tracking
• Blood type compatibility awareness
• Stud coordination (your own and outside studs)

Client Management
• Waitlist with preferences (color, sex, personality type)
• Communication history searchable and complete
• Contracts stored and accessible
• Deposit tracking

Business Operations
• Invoicing tied to specific kittens
• Payment status clear at a glance
• Expense tracking for tax purposes

Buyer Experience
• Portal for buyers to see kitten development
• Health documentation access
• Professional presentation
```

## Section 6: How BreederHQ Supports This

### Headline
```
BreederHQ understands cats
```

### Body
```
Built with induced ovulation in mind. Tracking that accounts for how cats actually cycle. Genetic marker tracking for breed-specific concerns. Waitlist management that handles "I want a blue point female" requests. Buyer portals so you're not sending the same kitten photos individually to 15 people.

# HORSE BREEDING PAGE (/horses)

## Section 1: What This Page Is About

### Headline
```
Horse Breeding Software for Serious Breeders
```

### Body
```
Horse breeding operates on different timescales than small animals. Eleven-month gestation. Seasonal cycling. Higher stakes per breeding. Complex ownership arrangements. Different record-keeping requirements entirely.

Generic breeding software—even good breeding software—doesn't account for any of this.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
When your breeding operation outgrows basic tools
```

### Body
```
Equine breeding programs hit complexity at different points than small animal operations:

• Managing seasonal cycling across multiple mares
• Coordinating with stallion owners and breeding facilities
• Tracking AI and embryo transfer details
• Maintaining records for breed registries
• High-value transactions requiring clear documentation
• Foaling schedules that can't be missed

The stakes are higher. The timelines are longer. The margin for error is smaller.
```

---

## Section 3: How Breeders Usually Handle It

### Headline
```
Common approaches in equine breeding
```

### Body
```
Farm management software
General farm tools that have a "breeding" module bolted on. Not built for breeding—built for farm management with breeding as an afterthought.

Spreadsheets and calendars
Mare sheets. Stallion logs. Breeding calendars on the wall. Works until you're managing more than a handful of mares or coordinating with outside stallions.

Breed registry systems
Registry-specific tools that handle registration but not the day-to-day management of your operation.

Memory and experience
"She usually cycles around late March." Twenty years of experience keeping it all in your head. Works until it doesn't.
```

---

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why equine breeding needs specialized tools
```

### Body
```
Horse-specific biology:

Seasonal polyestrous
Mares cycle in response to increasing daylight. The breeding season is finite. Missing optimal cycles means waiting an entire year.

Extended gestation
• ~340 days (11+ months)
• Long planning horizons
• Foaling dates that matter enormously

Breeding method complexity
• Live cover coordination
• Artificial insemination timing
• Embryo transfer programs
• Shipped semen logistics

What generic tools miss:
• Seasonal cycling patterns
• 11-month forward planning
• Breeding method tracking
• Stallion coordination across facilities
• Foal heat breeding windows
• Mare history across multiple seasons

# GOAT BREEDING PAGE (/goats)

## Section 1: What This Page Is About

### Headline
```
Goat Breeding Software for Dairy and Meat Operations
```

### Body
```
Goat breeding—whether dairy, meat, or fiber—has specific requirements that generic livestock software handles poorly. Seasonal breeding windows. ADGA or registry requirements. Disease testing protocols. Multiple kids per kidding.

This is software built for goat breeders specifically.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
When your goat operation needs better systems
```

### Body
```
Goat operations hit management complexity quickly:

• Seasonal breeding with a limited window
• Multiple does cycling at once
• Disease testing requirements (CAE, CL, Johne's)
• ADGA or other registry paperwork
• Tracking multiple kids per doe
• Milk production records for dairy operations
• Buyer waitlists for quality breeding stock

If you're spending more time on paperwork than with your goats, something needs to change.
```

## Section 3: How Breeders Usually Handle It

### Headline
```
How goat breeders typically manage records
```

### Body
```
Notebooks and barn cards
Does have cards on their stalls. Breeding dates in a notebook. Kidding records on paper. Works until the notebook gets wet or you need to find something from two years ago.

Spreadsheets
Herd list in one sheet. Breeding records in another. Kid records in a third. No connection between them. Formulas that seemed like a good idea but now confuse everyone.

ADGA or registry tools
Good for registration. Not designed for daily herd management.

Memory
"She was bred in late October." "I think those kids are out of the spotted buck." Memory works until it fails at the worst possible moment.
```

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why goat breeding needs specialized tools
```

### Body
```
Goat-specific biology:

Seasonal breeding
Most goats are seasonal breeders (fall). The breeding window is limited. Miss it and you wait a year. Some breeds can cycle year-round, adding complexity.

Short cycles
18-24 day cycles during breeding season. Multiple opportunities but easy to lose track.

Multiple kids
Twins, triplets, and more are common. Each kid needs tracking from birth through sale.

Disease testing
• CAE (Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis)
• CL (Caseous Lymphadenitis)
• Johne's disease
• Annual testing often required for sales

What generic tools miss:
• Seasonal breeding window tracking
• Multiple offspring per birth
• Disease testing schedules and results
• Milk production integration (dairy)
• ADGA linear appraisal records

### Headline
```
Rabbit Breeding Software for Serious Rabbitries
```

### Body
```
Rabbit breeding moves fast. 31-day gestation. Multiple litters per year. Rapid kindling cycles. What works for dogs or horses doesn't work for rabbits—the pace is completely different.

This is software that keeps up with rabbit breeding.
```

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
When your rabbitry needs real tracking
```

### Body
```
Rabbit breeders hit management challenges quickly:

• Multiple does kindling in the same month
• Short breeding cycles requiring quick decisions
• Pedigrees across many generations of rapid breeding
• Show records for ARBA registration
• Culling decisions based on production and type
• Buyer waitlists for specific colors or varieties

The speed of rabbit breeding makes manual tracking nearly impossible at scale.

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why rabbit breeding needs modern tools
```

### Body
```
Rabbit-specific biology:

Induced ovulation
Like cats, rabbits are induced ovulators. Does can be bred at almost any time, which creates both flexibility and tracking challenges.

Rapid reproduction
• 31-33 day gestation
• Does can be rebred shortly after kindling
• Multiple litters per year per doe
• Rapid generation turnover

Volume challenges
• Many kits per litter
• Quick decisions needed on keepers vs. culls
• Pedigrees multiply fast
• Records accumulate rapidly

What generic tools miss:
• The pace of rabbit breeding
• Kit tracking from birth
• Rapid pedigree generation
• Show record integration
• Production tracking (meat rabbits)
• Color genetics tracking

Sheep operations face specific challenges:

• Seasonal breeding condensed into fall months
• Lambing season intensity
• Multiple lambs per ewe
• OPP and disease testing requirements
• NSIP data submission for performance flocks
• Fiber records for wool breeds
• Buyer demand for documented genetics

Spreadsheets
Ewe list. Ram list. Lambing records. Wool weights. Performance data. None of it talking to each other.

NSIP submission tools
Good for data submission. Not designed for daily flock management.

Memory and ear tags
"The blue-tagged ewes were with the Dorset ram." Memory-based management works in small flocks. It doesn't scale.

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why sheep breeding needs the right tools
```

### Body
```
Sheep-specific biology:

Seasonal breeding
Most sheep are fall breeders. The ram goes in, and you have a defined window. Tracking who's bred when matters.

Lambing complexity
• 147-day gestation (~5 months)
• Singles, twins, triplets common
• Lambing season can be intense
• Each lamb needs tracking

Performance considerations
• Growth rates and weaning weights
• NSIP estimated breeding values
• Fleece weight and quality (fiber breeds)
• Reproductive efficiency

Health requirements
• OPP (Ovine Progressive Pneumonia) testing
• Scrapie program compliance
• Vaccination records

### Headline
```
How Professional Breeders Track Breeding Cycles
```

### Body
```
Breeding success depends on timing. Miss a cycle and you wait months for the next opportunity. Mistime a breeding and it fails. This page explains how experienced breeders track cycles, where most systems fail, and what actually works.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
The cost of missed timing
```

### Body
```
Missed breeding windows mean:

• Waiting months for the next opportunity (6+ months for dogs)
• Lost income from planned litters that didn't happen
• Disappointed buyers on your waitlist
• Cascading schedule problems that affect everything else
• Stud availability that may not align with the next cycle

Most breeders search for cycle tracking help after they've already missed something important. The cost of that miss is what drives the search.
```

---

## Section 3: How Breeders Usually Handle It

### Headline
```
Common approaches to cycle tracking
```

### Body
```
Calendar apps with manual reminders
You set a reminder for "6 months from now." When it fires, you may or may not remember what it was about. No connection to the animal. No adjustment for individual patterns.

Spreadsheets with date formulas
Enter the last heat date, formula calculates the next one. Works until you realize the formula assumes every female cycles on exactly the same schedule. They don't.

Memory
"She was in heat around Christmas." "I think her last cycle was in October." Memory works until you have more than three or four breeding females. Then it fails.

Reactive progesterone testing
Testing when you think she might be coming in. Better than nothing, but expensive and stressful when you're guessing.

Generic pet apps
Apps designed for pet owners, not breeders. They'll remind you about vet appointments but don't understand breeding cycles.
```

---

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why these approaches fail
```

### Body
```
They don't account for individual variation
Not every female cycles on schedule. Some cycle every 5 months, some every 8. Some are regular, some aren't. Intervals vary by individual, age, stress, and season. Your reminder set for "6 months" is just a guess.

They don't handle the exceptions
Split heats happen. Silent heats happen. Irregular cycles happen. Stress delays cycles. Health issues affect timing. A simple calendar can't account for any of this.

They don't connect to everything else
A calendar reminder doesn't link to the animal's record. It doesn't show you which females will overlap. It doesn't calculate forward to whelping dates. It doesn't warn you about conflicts with planned vacations or shows.

They make you the database
You have to remember to set the reminder. You have to calculate the dates. You have to cross-reference against other females. You are the single point of failure. When you forget, the system fails.
```

## Section 5: What a Correct System Looks Like

### Headline
```
What proper cycle tracking requires
```

### Body
```

• Records each heat with dates and observations
• Tracks the actual interval for each individual female
• Predicts next heat based on her pattern, not a generic average
• Adjusts predictions as more data accumulates

Connects forward
• Breeding date → expected whelping date (auto-calculated)
• Whelping date → weaning date → placement window
• All dates visible on a single calendar
• Changes ripple through automatically

Shows the full picture
• All breeding females on one view
• Overlapping cycles highlighted
• Potential conflicts identified before they happen

## Section 9: FAQ

### Q1
**Question:** What if my female has irregular cycles?
**Answer:** The system tracks her actual pattern, not a generic average. Irregular cycles are recorded and factored into predictions.

### Q2
**Question:** Can I track split heats?
**Answer:** Yes. Unusual cycles can be noted and recorded.

### Q3
**Question:** Does it work for induced ovulators (cats/rabbits)?
**Answer:** Yes. Different species have different cycle logic built in. Cats and rabbits aren't treated like dogs.

### Q4
**Question:** Can I track progesterone testing?
**Answer:** Yes. Test dates and results can be logged, helping you see patterns over time.

### Q5
**Question:** What if I use a reproductive vet?
**Answer:** Many breeders do. BreederHQ tracks the data they give you, keeping it organized with the rest of the animal's record.

How to Manage Breeding Waitlists Without Losing Your Mind

### Body
```
A healthy waitlist is a sign of a successful breeding program. It's also a management nightmare if you don't have a system. This page explains how to run waitlists professionally without drowning in spreadsheets and text messages.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
The waitlist problem
```

### Body
```
When your waitlist grows, chaos grows with it:

• Who's first? Who's second? Who was actually promised that female?
• Which deposits have been paid? Which are pending?
• Who wants a specific color? Who's flexible?
• What did you tell that person six months ago?
• Who needs to be contacted when a litter is born?
• Who's ghosted and should be removed?

Every breeder with a waitlist eventually finds themselves scrolling through months of messages trying to figure out who gets which puppy. That's not a system. That's a crisis.
```

---

## Section 3: How Breeders Usually Handle It

### Headline
```
Common waitlist approaches
```

### Body
```
Spreadsheets
A list with names, dates, preferences, deposits. Works until it doesn't match your memory. Or until you forget to update it. Or until you need to see it on your phone at a puppy pickup.

Notebooks
Names and phone numbers. Maybe some notes about what they want. Good luck searching it.

Memory
"I think she was third on the list." "I'm pretty sure he wanted a male." Memory is not a waitlist system.

Email folders
Inquiries in one folder. Approved people in another. Finding the email where someone told you their color preference? Good luck.

Facebook Messenger
An endless scroll of conversations with people you can't quite remember. Which ones are serious? Which ones disappeared? No idea without reading every thread.
```

---

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why waitlists get messy
```

### Body
```
Position changes
People drop off. New people join. Someone was promised first pick but then someone else paid a deposit earlier. Was it first-come or first-deposit? What were your rules again?

Preferences are complex
"I want a red female, but I'd consider a sable male if no red females are available." That's not a checkbox. That's a conversation. Where is that conversation recorded?

Communication history matters
Six months ago, someone asked about your health testing. You answered. Now they're asking again. Did they forget? Did you forget to answer? Where's the thread?

Deposits and payments
Who's paid? Who hasn't? Is that deposit for this litter or the next one? What were the terms? Where's the record?

Matching is judgment
Placing animals isn't just first-in-first-out. You're matching personalities, lifestyles, and expectations. That requires information you can access quickly, not scattered across platforms.

# WORKFLOW: GENETICS AND HEALTH TESTING (/workflows/genetics-and-health-testing)

## Section 1: What This Page Is About

### Headline
```
How to Track Genetics and Health Testing for Breeding
```

### Body
```
Health testing isn't optional for responsible breeders. But tracking test results, remembering renewal dates, and sharing documentation with buyers? That's where systems fail. This page covers how to manage genetics and health testing properly.
```

---

## Section 2: Why Breeders Search for This

### Headline
```
The health testing challenge
```

### Body
```
Health testing creates management complexity:

• Different tests for different breeds
• Some tests are one-time (DNA), some need renewal (eyes, cardiac)
• Results live in different places (OFA database, lab reports, vet records)
• Buyers want proof, but finding it takes time
• Breeding decisions depend on having current information
• Forgetting a renewal can affect sales and reputation

A breeder who does health testing but can't prove it easily has the worst of both worlds: the cost without the credibility.
```

---

## Section 3: How Breeders Usually Handle It

### Headline
```
How breeders typically track health testing
```

### Body
```
Paper files
A folder per animal with test results stuffed inside. Finding a specific result means digging through papers. Sharing with a buyer means scanning or photographing.

Email folders
Lab results in email. OFA certificates in another email. Scattered across years of messages.

OFA database
The official record for many tests. But it doesn't include everything, and you can't attach your own notes or track pending tests.

Memory
"I know she's been tested." "I think that was last year?" Memory fails exactly when you need it.

Spreadsheets
A list of tests and dates. No connection to the animal's other records. No attached documents. No reminders.
```

---

## Section 4: Where That Breaks Down

### Headline
```
Why health testing tracking fails
```

### Body
```
Results are scattered
DNA results from one lab. OFA results from the database. Eye exam from the veterinary ophthalmologist. Cardiac clearance from a cardiologist. Each in a different format, stored in a different place.

Renewals are missed
Eye exams need annual renewal. Cardiac clearances may need renewal. Easy to forget when you're managing multiple animals with different test dates.

Sharing is painful
A buyer asks for proof of health testing. You spend 30 minutes finding documents, scanning them, and sending them. Multiply by every serious buyer inquiry.

Breeding decisions lack information
You're planning a breeding. What's the genetic compatibility? Is her cardiac clearance current? When was his last eye exam? If this information isn't instantly accessible, you're guessing.

Genetics tracking is complex
Coat color genetics. Health marker genetics. Carrier status. What happens when you breed two carriers? The information exists, but is it organized enough to use?
```

• Professional presentation
• No scanning and emailing for each inquiry
```

## Section 6: How BreederHQ Supports This

### Headline
```
BreederHQ organizes health testing
```

### Body
```
All test results attached to the animal. Documents stored and accessible. Renewal reminders automated. Genetics tracked and visible. Buyer portal access so you're not scanning documents for every inquiry.

Health testing done right, finally organized.

## Section 7: Who This Is For

### Headline
```
This matters for breeders who:
```

### Body
```
• Do health testing (obviously)
• Have multiple animals with different test schedules
• Share results with buyers
• Make breeding decisions based on genetics
• Want to stop losing track of documents
```

---

## Section 8: Who This Is Not For

### Headline
```
This might be overkill if:
```

### Body
```
• You don't do health testing
• You have one or two animals and paper files work
• You're not sharing documentation with buyers
```

---

## Section 9: FAQ

### Q1
**Question:** Can I store actual documents (PDFs, images)?
**Answer:** Yes. Attach certificates, lab reports, and exam results directly to the animal's record.

### Q2
**Question:** Does it remind me when tests expire?
**Answer:** Yes. Tests with renewal requirements are tracked and flagged.

### Q3
**Question:** Can buyers see health testing?
**Answer:** Yes. The buyer portal shows what you choose to share. You control visibility.

### Q4
**Question:** Does it track genetics?
**Answer:** Yes. Color genetics, health markers, carrier status.

### Q5
**Question:** What about OFA integration?
**Answer:** You enter OFA results manually. BreederHQ doesn't pull from OFA automatically, but your records can link to OFA for verification.

# COMPARISON: BREEDERHQ VS. SPREADSHEETS (/compare/breederhq-vs-spreadsheets)

## Opening

### Headline
```
BreederHQ vs. Spreadsheets: When to Switch
```

### Body
```
Spreadsheets work. For a while.
They break at predictable points.
This page helps you know when you've hit that point.
```

---

## When Spreadsheets Work

### Headline
```
When spreadsheets are fine
```

### Body
```
Spreadsheets are a reasonable choice when:

• You have 1-5 animals
• You produce occasional litters (1-2 per year)
• You enjoy building and maintaining systems
• You don't have a waitlist (or a very short one)
• You're the only one who needs access
• You don't mind being the database

Seriously: if a spreadsheet is working for you, keep using it. Software isn't always the answer. The best system is the one you'll actually use.
```

---

## When Spreadsheets Break

### Headline
```
When spreadsheets stop working
```

### Body
```
Spreadsheets typically fail when:

• Multiple breeding females with overlapping cycles
  You can't see the conflict until it's a problem.

• Waitlist longer than you can track mentally
  Position, preferences, deposits, communication—too much for cells.

• Buyers expecting regular updates and communication
  Copy-pasting from a spreadsheet into texts isn't scalable.

• Health testing records scattered across multiple files
  The spreadsheet knows the test exists. It doesn't have the document.

• Invoicing disconnected from animal records
  Separate systems that don't talk to each other.

• A partner, assistant, or family member needs access
  "Let me send you the latest version" is a recipe for disaster.

• You're spending more time on admin than animals
  Data entry isn't why you started breeding.

• You've forgotten something important more than once
  The spreadsheet doesn't remind you. You have to remember to check it.

If three or more of these apply, you've probably outgrown spreadsheets.

## The Real Question

### Headline
```
What is your time worth?
```

### Body
```
If you spend 5+ hours per month on breeding administration—entering data, cross-referencing sheets, answering buyer questions, tracking payments, setting reminders, finding documents—then $39/month pays for itself if it saves you even two hours.

More importantly: what's the cost of a mistake?

A missed breeding window. A forgotten health test renewal. A buyer who got the wrong information. A deposit you forgot to record. These aren't hypothetical. They happen when you're the single point of failure.

The real cost of spreadsheets isn't the software. It's your time. And the mistakes that happen when you're overloaded.
```

---

## Conclusion

### Headline
```
The bottom line
```

### Body
```
Spreadsheets are fine until they're not.

Most breeders hit the breaking point somewhere between 5 and 15 animals, or when they start having overlapping litters, or when their waitlist grows beyond a handful of people.

If you're there—if the spreadsheet is causing stress instead of reducing it—BreederHQ removes the chaos.

If you're not there yet, keep the spreadsheet. Bookmark this page. Come back when you need us.

# COMPARISON: BEST BREEDING SOFTWARE (/compare/best-breeding-software)

## Opening

### Headline
```
How to Choose Breeding Software in 2026
```

### Body
```
There are many options for breeding software. Some are good. Some are not. This page explains what to look for and what to avoid—whether you choose BreederHQ or something else.
```

---

## What to Look For

### Headline
```
What actually matters in breeding software
```

### Body
```
Species-appropriate design
Software built for dogs shouldn't be used for horses. Software built for pets shouldn't be used for breeding. The system needs to understand breeding biology—cycles, gestation, litter management—for your species.

Connected records
Your animal records, breeding records, client records, and financial records should be connected. If you have to cross-reference between systems or manually copy data, you're doing work the software should do.

Actual breeding tools
Not just a database with a "breeding" label. Cycle tracking. Date calculations. Breeding calendars. Litter management. Genetics tracking. If the software doesn't help you plan and manage breedings, it's not breeding software.

Client management
Breeding is a relationship business. Your software should help you manage those relationships—waitlists, communication, contracts, documents.

Buyer-facing tools
Modern buyers expect more than emails and text messages. A buyer portal, documentation sharing, and professional presentation matter.

Mobile access
You're not always at your desk. The software should work on your phone when you're in the barn, at a show, or meeting a buyer.

Sustainable company
Software that hasn't been updated in years won't be around in five more. Look for active development and responsive support.
```

---

## What to Avoid

### Headline
```
Red flags in breeding software
```

### Body
```
"We do everything for everyone"
Software that claims to handle dogs, cats, horses, livestock, exotics, and also be a general farm management tool probably does none of them well.

Ancient interfaces
If the software looks like it was built in 2005 and hasn't been updated since, expect a frustrating experience.

No trial period
Any confident software company offers a free trial. If they won't let you try before buying, ask why.

Desktop-only
If the software only runs on one computer with no cloud access, you're trapped. What happens when that computer fails?

Lifetime licenses with no updates
Cheap upfront, expensive later. Software that isn't actively maintained becomes a liability.

Feature lists without depth
"Pedigrees! Health tracking! Breeding management!" Every software claims these. Ask how deep each feature goes.
```

---

# ABOUT PAGE (/about)

## Section 1: Why We Exist

### Headline
```
Why BreederHQ exists
```

### Body
```
Most breeding software is built by software companies who added "breeding" to their feature list. They build generic databases, slap on a few breeding-related labels, and call it done.

BreederHQ is different.

It was built by people who understand what breeding programs actually require—the biology, the workflows, the pressure, the chaos that happens when systems fail.

We built the software we wished existed.
```

---

## Section 2: What We Believe

### Headline
```
What we believe
```

### Body
```
Breeding is a profession that deserves professional tools.
Too many breeders are stuck with spreadsheets, paper records, and software designed for something else. That's not good enough.

Software should understand biology.
Generic databases don't know the difference between a dog in estrus and a cat in estrus. They don't understand gestation periods, litter sizes, or health testing protocols. Breeding software should.

Breeders shouldn't have to become database administrators.
You started breeding because you love animals, not because you wanted to manage spreadsheet formulas. The software should handle the complexity so you can focus on the animals.

Buyers deserve transparency.
And breeders deserve tools that make transparency easy. Buyer portals, health documentation sharing, and professional presentation should be built in, not bolted on.

The best software is invisible.
It does its job without making you think about it. Reminders happen automatically. Calculations are correct. Information is where you expect it. You spend your time on animals, not administration.
