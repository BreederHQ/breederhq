---

## TL;DR Box

Professional breeders need professional visibility. The BreederHQ Marketplace lets you list available animals, upcoming litters, and breeding programs. Verification badges prove your credibility. Buyer inquiries arrive in your dashboard—organized, tracked, and ready to convert. Marketplace access is included with your BreederHQ subscription.

---

## Section 1: The Visibility Problem

You do the work. You health test. You screen buyers carefully. You produce quality animals.

But getting discovered? That's a different challenge.

**Where breeders currently market:**
- **Facebook groups** — Posts disappear in hours. Self-promotion often banned. No way to stand out from less responsible breeders.
- **Breed club directories** — Limited reach. Often outdated. No buyer engagement features.
- **Your own website** — Requires SEO knowledge. Competes with millions of other sites. Buyers don't know to search for you specifically.
- **Word of mouth** — Works, but doesn't scale. You're limited to your existing network.

The result: quality breeders get lost in the noise, while buyers struggle to find programs they can trust.

## Section 2: What the Marketplace Does for Breeders

The BreederHQ Marketplace creates a dedicated space where serious buyers search for responsible breeders. Your program gets visibility. Buyers get confidence. Everyone wins.

### Your Public Profile

When buyers search the marketplace, they find your breeder profile:

- **Program overview** — Your breeding philosophy, experience, and goals
- **Species and breeds** — What you work with
- **Photos and media** — Your animals, your facilities, your story
- **Location** — Where you're based and how far you serve
- **Verification badges** — Trust signals that prove your credibility (more below)
- **Response metrics** — How quickly you typically reply to inquiries

Your profile connects directly to your BreederHQ data. No duplicate entry. Update your program information once, and it reflects everywhere.

---

### Your Listings

Showcase what's available:

**Available Animals**
- Individual animals ready for placement
- Photos, pricing, and descriptions
- Listing types: pet homes, breeding prospects, show prospects, rehomes

**Upcoming Litters**
- Expected birth dates
- Sire and dam information with photos
- Deposit status and waitlist availability
- Automatic updates as the breeding progresses

**Programs**
- Stud services with terms and pricing
- Guardian placements
- Co-ownership opportunities
- Trained or started animals

Each listing pulls from your existing BreederHQ records. Health testing, pedigree data, and genetic information are already there—just choose what to display publicly.

---

### Your Inquiry Management

When a buyer finds your listing and reaches out, you're ready:

- **All inquiries in one inbox** — No more scattered Facebook messages, emails, and texts
- **Buyer information captured** — What they're looking for, their timeline, their questions
- **Response tracking** — See how quickly you replied (and earn badges for fast responses)
- **One-click conversion** — Move interested buyers to your waitlist directly
- **Communication history** — Every message preserved for reference

Stop losing leads to overflowing inboxes. The marketplace keeps buyer relationships organized from first contact.

## Section 3: Verification Badges — Credibility That's Earned

Anyone can claim to be a responsible breeder. Badges prove it.

### Verified Breeder Badge

**What it means:** Identity and program documentation confirmed.

**How you earn it:** Submit business documentation, facility information, and references for review.

**Why it matters:** Buyers know you're legitimate. Scam operations can't fake verification.

---

### Health Testing Badge

**What it means:** Health testing documentation on file for your breeding animals.

**How you earn it:** Upload health testing results (OFA, genetic panels, specialist clearances) to BreederHQ.

**Why it matters:** Proves your commitment to breeding healthy animals. Buyers prioritize health-tested programs.

---

### Quick Responder Badge

**What it means:** You respond to inquiries within 4 hours during business hours.

**How you earn it:** Automatically awarded based on your actual response times. Requires minimum 5 responses.

**Why it matters:** Buyers hate waiting. This badge tells them you communicate promptly.

*This badge can't be bought or applied for. Your behavior earns it.*

---

### Experienced Breeder Badge

**What it means:** 5+ successful placements completed through BreederHQ.

**How you earn it:** Automatically awarded after 5 placements with buyer confirmation.

**Why it matters:** Track record matters. This proves you deliver on your promises.

*This badge can't be bought or applied for. Your history earns it.*

## Section 4: How Buyers Find You

When buyers search the BreederHQ Marketplace, they can filter by:

- **Species** — Dogs, cats, horses, goats, rabbits, sheep
- **Breed** — Specific breeds or "any"
- **Location** — Distance from their location
- **Availability** — Animals available now, waitlist open, accepting inquiries
- **Verification** — Show only verified breeders, health-tested programs, quick responders

Your visibility depends on:
- **Profile completeness** — More information = higher ranking
- **Verification badges** — Verified breeders appear higher
- **Response time** — Quick responders get priority
- **Activity** — Active listings rank above stale ones

The marketplace rewards responsible, engaged breeders. No paid placements. No gaming the system. Quality rises to the top.

## Section 5: Marketplace vs. Facebook Groups

Facebook groups work—sort of. But compare the experience:

| Facebook Groups | BreederHQ Marketplace |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Posts disappear in hours | Listings stay visible and searchable |
| No verification system | 4 badges prove credibility |
| Self-promotion often banned | Built for listing animals—that's the point |
| Inquiries scattered across Messenger | All inquiries in one organized inbox |
| No response tracking | Quick Responder badge rewards engagement |
| No connection to your breeding data | Listings pull from your BreederHQ records |
| Anyone can post | Only BreederHQ subscribers can list |

Facebook is for community. The Marketplace is for business.

## Section 7: Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Litter Announcement

You have a litter due in 6 weeks. You want to fill your waitlist.

**Without the Marketplace:** Post on Facebook (disappears in a day). Email your past buyers (limited reach). Hope word spreads.

**With the Marketplace:** Create an upcoming litter listing. Buyers searching for your breed find it. Inquiries arrive in your dashboard. You respond quickly (earning your Quick Responder badge). Interested buyers join your waitlist with one click.

### Scenario 2: The Available Adult

You have a retired breeding dog ready for a pet home. She deserves the right family.

**Without the Marketplace:** Post on Facebook (mixed with puppy mill posts). Field random inquiries with no screening.

**With the Marketplace:** List her with full details. Your Verified Breeder and Health Testing badges signal quality. Serious buyers inquire through the platform. You review their information and respond to the best matches.

### Scenario 3: Stud Services

Your champion male is available for outside breedings. You want to reach breeders beyond your immediate network.

**Without the Marketplace:** Word of mouth. Breed club listings. Hope other breeders hear about him.

**With the Marketplace:** Create a stud service listing with his pedigree, health testing, and your terms. Breeders searching for studs in your breed find him. Inquiries include what they're looking for, so you can evaluate fit before responding.

---

## Section 8: Who the Marketplace Is For

**The Marketplace works for breeders who:**

- Have animals to place or waitlists to fill
- Want professional visibility beyond word of mouth
- Value their reputation and want badges to prove it
- Spend too much time on Facebook with little return
- Prefer organized inquiry management over scattered messages
- Are already using BreederHQ for breeding management

---

## Section 9: Who the Marketplace Is NOT For

**The Marketplace probably isn't for you if:**

- You don't want to be found (some breeders prefer referral-only)
- You produce animals without health testing or documentation
- You're not willing to respond to inquiries professionally
- You're looking to hide rather than build reputation

The marketplace rewards transparency. If that's not your approach, other channels may be a better fit.
