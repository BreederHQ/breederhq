## Hero Section

**H1**: Give Every Client a Professional Experience

**Subheadline**: The Client Portal gives buyers 24/7 access to their animal's information, secure payments, digital contracts, and direct communication—reducing administrative overhead while building trust.

**CTA**: Get Early Access

**Supporting Copy**:
Professional breeding operations require professional client management. A dedicated portal centralizes updates, contracts, payments, and messaging—so important details don't fall through the cracks.

---

## TL;DR Box

Managing client relationships across email, text, and social media creates gaps. Important messages get lost. Deposit tracking becomes manual. Contract signatures require printing and scanning. A dedicated Client Portal gives each buyer their own secure login where they can view updates, pay invoices via Stripe, sign contracts electronically, and message you directly. You see all client activity in one dashboard. Clients get self-service access. Administrative overhead drops significantly.

---

## Section 1: The Administrative Overhead Problem

Professional breeding programs generate significant client communication:

- Photo updates during pregnancy and after birth
- Deposit requests and payment confirmations
- Contract delivery, signature, and storage
- Balance inquiries and payment tracking
- Document sharing (health records, pedigrees, certificates)
- Ongoing questions and follow-ups

When this communication happens across email, text, Facebook Messenger, and phone calls, details fall through the cracks. Contracts get lost in inboxes. Deposit status becomes uncertain. Clients ask questions that were already answered.

The result: hours of administrative work that doesn't directly serve your breeding program—plus the risk of appearing disorganized to discerning buyers.

A centralized portal addresses this by giving clients self-service access while keeping everything organized on your end.

## Section 2: What Your Clients See

When you invite a client to the portal, they get their own secure login and dashboard. Here's what they can access:

### Dashboard with Action Items

The moment a client logs in, they see what matters:

- **Photo carousel** of their animal (auto-rotating, uploaded by you)
- **Recent updates** you've posted
- **Action required** badges (overdue payments, contracts awaiting signature)
- **Financial snapshot** with balance due and progress bar
- **Activity timeline** showing recent interactions

No confusion. No "where do I find...?" questions. Everything is right there.

---

### Financial Transparency

Clients can see their complete financial picture:

**Invoice details:**
- Line-item breakdown (deposit, animal price, shipping, health kit, etc.)
- Invoice status (Paid, Due, Overdue)
- Payment history with dates and methods
- Receipt access for completed payments

**Pay Now functionality:**
- Clients click "Pay Now" and complete payment via Stripe
- Accepts credit card, debit card
- You receive funds directly—no chasing, no reminders
- Automatic receipt generation

**Balance tracking:**
- Total due clearly displayed
- Overdue amounts highlighted
- Progress bar showing payment completion
- Deposit vs. remaining balance breakdown

No more awkward "did you send the deposit?" texts. Clients see what they owe and can pay instantly.

---

### Digital Contracts & E-Signatures

Contracts handled without printing, scanning, or mailing:

**For you:**
- Upload contract templates
- Send contracts to specific clients
- Track signature status (Pending, Signed, Declined, Expired)
- Store signed copies permanently in the client record

**For clients:**
- Review contract terms in the portal
- Sign electronically with legal validity
- Download signed copies for their records
- Clear status so they know what's pending

**Contract types you might use:**
- Purchase agreement
- Health guarantee
- Spay/neuter agreement
- Co-ownership terms
- Breeding rights contract
- Guardian home agreement

Every signed document is timestamped, stored, and accessible to both parties.

---

### Secure Messaging

All communication in one thread:

**For you:**
- See complete conversation history with each client
- Reply from the portal or email
- Attach files (photos, documents, certificates)
- Know when messages are read

**For clients:**
- Message you directly through the portal
- Attach files up to 10MB
- See unread indicators
- Get email notifications for your replies

No more hunting through texts, Facebook messages, and emails to piece together a conversation. Everything is in one place.

---

### Document Access

Clients can view everything you choose to share:

**Document categories:**
- **Health Records** — Vet visits, vaccinations, deworming schedules
- **Pedigree** — Lineage documentation
- **Contracts** — Signed agreements
- **Photos** — Growth photos, litter photos
- **Other** — Registration papers, microchip info, anything else

You control what's visible. Clients can view and download—but can't edit or delete.

---

### Activity Feed

A complete timeline of everything that's happened:

- When they joined the waitlist
- When they paid their deposit
- When they signed their contract
- Every message sent and received
- Every document shared
- Every update you posted

Clients never have to ask "when did I...?" The timeline has every answer.

---

## Section 3: What You See (Breeder Side)

The Client Portal isn't just for clients. It transforms how you manage relationships.

### Per-Client Dashboard

For each client, you see:

- **Contact information** and preferences
- **Financial status** at a glance (paid, due, overdue)
- **Contract status** (pending signatures highlighted)
- **Communication history** (every message, note, email)
- **Document inventory** (what you've shared)
- **Activity log** (everything they've done in the portal)

One screen tells you everything about the relationship.

---

### Financial Management

Across all clients:

- **Outstanding invoices total** — Know what's owed
- **Overdue payments flagged** — See who needs a nudge
- **Month-to-date collected** — Track your income
- **Deposit timing analysis** — See patterns in when clients pay

Invoice directly from BreederHQ. Accept payments via Stripe. Track everything automatically.

---

### Bulk Actions

Managing multiple clients at once:

- Send updates to everyone on a waitlist
- Share photos with an entire litter's buyers
- Issue invoices to multiple clients
- Bundle documents for common scenarios (application stage, deposit stage, pickup stage)

Stop doing the same task 8 times for 8 animals in a litter.

---

## Section 4: The Trust Factor

Client portals affect buyer perception beyond operational efficiency.

**What portal access signals to buyers:**

- Organization and attention to detail
- Financial transparency (clear records of what's owed and paid)
- Professional business practices
- Commitment to communication
- Documentation that protects both parties

**Common buyer frustrations without a portal:**

- Uncertainty about communication status ("Did they get my message?")
- Confusion about payment status ("How much do I still owe?")
- Difficulty accessing documents ("Where's my contract?")
- Feeling uninformed during wait periods

Buyers evaluating multiple breeders often choose the one who appears most organized and communicative. A portal creates that impression automatically through transparency and self-service access.

## Section 5: Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Anxious Waitlist Client

A buyer paid their deposit two months ago. The litter isn't due for another month. They're excited but anxious—this is their first animal from a breeder.

**Without a portal:** They text you every week asking for updates. You're annoyed. They feel ignored.

**With a portal:** They log in whenever they want. They see the dam's progress photos, the expected due date, and their position on the waitlist. They feel informed without bothering you.

### Scenario 2: The "Where's My Contract?" Question

A buyer asks for a copy of the contract they signed six months ago. They're updating their insurance and need it.

**Without a portal:** You dig through email, find the PDF, and send it. 15 minutes gone.

**With a portal:** "Log into your portal and download it from the Documents section." Done.

### Scenario 3: The Deposit Payment

A buyer is ready to secure their spot. You want a deposit.

**Without a portal:** You send PayPal info, or provide a Venmo handle, or ask them to mail a check. You track payment manually. You send a confirmation email.

**With a portal:** You create an invoice in BreederHQ. They get a notification. They click "Pay Now" and complete the transaction. The invoice marks as paid. They get a receipt. You get the funds. Total time: 2 minutes.

### Scenario 4: Pick-Up Day Preparation

Pickup is in a week. You need to share the health records, vaccination certificate, microchip registration, and care instructions.

**Without a portal:** You email five attachments, hope they download them, and print backup copies just in case.

**With a portal:** You upload everything to Documents. Client gets a notification. They download and print at their convenience. You have a record that they accessed the files.

## Section 6: Who This Is For

**The Client Portal transforms your operation if you:**

- Place multiple animals per year
- Want to appear professional to discerning buyers
- Spend too much time answering repetitive questions
- Track deposits and payments manually
- Use paper contracts or PDF email attachments
- Have clients who want frequent updates
- Maintain relationships after placement

---

## Section 7: Who This Is NOT For

**This might be more than you need if:**

- You place 1-2 animals per year to friends and family
- Your buyers don't expect digital communication
- You prefer phone calls and in-person interactions exclusively
- Your process is simple and doesn't involve deposits or contracts

Even then, the financial tracking alone eliminates accounting headaches.

## FAQ Section

**Q: Do clients have to create an account?**
A: You invite them by email. They set a password and they're in. One-time setup takes under a minute.

**Q: Can I control what clients see?**
A: Yes. You choose which documents to share, which information is visible, and what level of access each client has.

**Q: Does this replace my email communication?**
A: It can, but it doesn't have to. Messages sent through the portal also notify clients via email. They can reply from either place.

**Q: What payment methods are supported?**
A: Stripe powers the payment system. Clients can pay with credit card or debit card. Funds deposit directly to your connected bank account.

**Q: Is there a fee for processing payments?**
A: Standard Stripe processing fees apply (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction). BreederHQ doesn't add additional fees.

**Q: Can I use this for co-owners or guardian homes?**
A: Yes. Any client relationship works—buyers, co-owners, guardian families, waitlist members. The portal adapts to the relationship type.

**Q: What if a client loses access?**
A: You can reset their password or resend the invitation from your dashboard.

**Q: Are e-signatures legally valid?**
A: Yes. Electronic signatures are legally binding under the ESIGN Act and UETA in the United States, and equivalent legislation internationally.

**Q: Can clients see other clients' information?**
A: No. Each client only sees their own portal. Your other clients, animals, and business information are completely private.
