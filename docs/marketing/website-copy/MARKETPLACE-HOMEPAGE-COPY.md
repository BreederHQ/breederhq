# Marketplace Homepage Copy Deliverables

**Project**: BreederHQ Marketplace Homepage
**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Status**: Final Copy for Implementation
**In Response To**: `docs/marketplace/homepage-copywriter-brief.md`

---

## 1. Trust Bar Copy

### Scenario A: Cold Start (No Stats)

#### Option A (Recommended)
> "Professional breeders. Verified programs. Growing daily."

#### Option B
> "Where serious breeders list. New programs joining now."

#### Option C
> "A marketplace built for professionals. Breeders joining daily."

**Rationale**: These options acknowledge newness without apology. "Professional" and "verified" signal quality. "Growing daily" / "joining now" creates momentum without false urgency. Avoided "launching soon" which sounds incomplete.

---

### Scenario B: With Stats

#### Option A (Recommended)
| Stat | Label |
|------|-------|
| Breeders | "[X]+ Verified Programs" |
| Animals | "[X]+ Available Animals" |
| Reviews | "[X]+ Buyer Reviews" |

#### Option B
| Stat | Label |
|------|-------|
| Breeders | "[X]+ Active Breeders" |
| Animals | "[X]+ Animals Listed" |
| Reviews | "[X]+ Verified Reviews" |

**Rationale**:
- "Verified Programs" > "Verified Breeders" because it emphasizes the whole operation, not just the person
- "Available Animals" > "Animals Listed" because it's buyer-focused (what they can get)
- "Buyer Reviews" adds specificity; "Verified Reviews" adds credibility — choose based on whether verification is actually enforced

## 2. Empty State Copy

### Empty State: No Listings

#### Option A (Recommended)
- **Title**: "Be first to find your match"
- **Description**: "New breeding programs are adding animals now. Browse verified breeders while listings grow, or set up alerts for specific breeds."
- **Primary CTA**: "Browse Breeders"
- **Secondary CTA**: "Get Breed Alerts"

#### Option B
- **Title**: "Animals arriving daily"
- **Description**: "Breeders are adding their programs. Explore verified breeders now, or tell us what you're looking for."
- **Primary CTA**: "Explore Breeders"
- **Secondary CTA**: "Tell Us What You Want"

**Rationale**: "Be first" creates opportunity rather than apology. Gives two clear actions: browse what exists (breeders) or get notified. Avoids "check back soon" which is passive and unhelpful.

---

### Empty State: No Breeders

#### Option A (Recommended)
- **Title**: "The first breeders are setting up"
- **Description**: "Verified breeding programs are joining. Get notified when breeders in your area list, or join as one of the first."
- **Primary CTA**: "Get Notified"
- **Secondary CTA**: "Join as a Breeder"

#### Option B
- **Title**: "Building something better"
- **Description**: "We're onboarding verified breeders who meet our standards. Want to be notified when they're live, or join them?"
- **Primary CTA**: "Notify Me"
- **Secondary CTA**: "Apply to List"

**Rationale**: "First breeders are setting up" acknowledges reality while implying momentum. "Verified breeding programs" signals quality standards. Both CTAs are actionable.

---

### Empty State: No Services

#### Option A (Recommended)
- **Title**: "Professional services coming soon"
- **Description**: "Trainers, groomers, transporters, and more are joining. Offer your services to the breeding community?"
- **Primary CTA**: "Get Notified"
- **Secondary CTA**: "List Your Services Free"

#### Option B
- **Title**: "Services for serious breeders"
- **Description**: "We're adding professional providers who understand breeding programs. Want in?"
- **Primary CTA**: "Notify Me When Live"
- **Secondary CTA**: "Offer Your Services"

**Rationale**: "Professional services" signals quality over quantity. "List Your Services Free" is a stronger CTA than "Learn More" — it's specific and low-commitment.

## 3. "How It Works" Section Copy

### Option A (Recommended): Browse → Verify → Connect

#### Step 1: Browse Programs
- **Title**: "Browse full programs"
- **Description**: "Search by breed, location, or species. See complete breeding operations — animals, health records, pedigrees — not isolated listings."

#### Step 2: Verify Credentials
- **Title**: "Check their track record"
- **Description**: "Review health testing results, breeding history, and buyer reviews before you reach out. Know who you're working with."

#### Step 3: Connect Directly
- **Title**: "Message breeders directly"
- **Description**: "Ask questions, request additional info, or schedule a visit. No middlemen, no waiting for callbacks."

---

### Option B: Search → Trust → Contact

#### Step 1: Search
- **Title**: "Find what you're looking for"
- **Description**: "Filter by breed, species, location, and availability. See actual breeding programs, not just listings."

#### Step 2: Trust
- **Title**: "See the whole picture"
- **Description**: "Health testing, pedigrees, past litters, buyer reviews. Everything you need to make an informed decision."

#### Step 3: Contact
- **Title**: "Reach out directly"
- **Description**: "Message breeders through the platform. Ask questions, share what you're looking for, schedule visits."

---

### Option C: Discover → Research → Reach Out

#### Step 1: Discover
- **Title**: "Discover breeding programs"
- **Description**: "Not random listings — real breeding operations. Search by what matters: breed, location, health testing, availability."

#### Step 2: Research
- **Title**: "Do your homework"
- **Description**: "Every program shows health records, pedigrees, breeding history, and reviews. No guesswork required."

#### Step 3: Reach Out
- **Title**: "Start the conversation"
- **Description**: "Message breeders directly with questions. They're running professional programs and expect serious inquiries."

**Rationale**: Option A is cleanest. "Browse full programs" immediately differentiates from classifieds. "Check their track record" is active and buyer-empowering. "Message breeders directly" is simple and clear.

---

## 4. Main Value Proposition Section

### Headline Options

#### Option A (Recommended)
> "Not a classified ad. A breeding program."

#### Option B
> "See the whole program, not just a listing."

#### Option C
> "Real breeding programs. Real transparency."

#### Option D
> "More than a listing. A complete picture."

**Recommendation**: Keep Option A. It's punchy, creates clear contrast, and the "breeding program" framing is the key differentiator.

---

### Description

#### Option A (Recommended)
> "BreederHQ breeders manage their entire operation here — animals, health records, pedigrees, breeding plans. What you see is their real program, not a one-time post that disappears tomorrow."

#### Option B
> "These aren't random listings. BreederHQ breeders use this platform daily to manage health records, track pedigrees, and plan breedings. You're seeing their actual operation."

**Rationale**: Added "not a one-time post that disappears tomorrow" to sharpen the contrast with Facebook/Craigslist listings.

---

### Three Supporting Points

#### Point 1: Full Program Visibility

**Option A (Recommended)**
- **Title**: "Full Program Visibility"
- **Description**: "See their animals, breeding history, health testing, and past litters. Not just the one they're selling today."

**Option B**
- **Title**: "The Complete Picture"
- **Description**: "Animals, health records, pedigrees, breeding plans — everything a responsible buyer should see before reaching out."

---

#### Point 2: Verified Credentials

**Option A (Recommended)**
- **Title**: "Verified Credentials"
- **Description**: "Health testing documentation, breeding history, and buyer reviews. Verify their track record before you contact them."

**Option B**
- **Title**: "Trust Signals That Matter"
- **Description**: "OFA results, genetic testing, past litter outcomes. Real credentials you can verify, not just claims."

**Note**: Changed from "Direct Connection" because trust/verification is more important than communication method. Direct messaging is table stakes.

---

#### Point 3: Active, Established Programs

**Option A (Recommended)**
- **Title**: "Active Programs"
- **Description**: "These breeders are actively managing their program on BreederHQ — updating records, tracking health, planning breedings. Not posting and ghosting."

**Option B**
- **Title**: "Ongoing Operations"
- **Description**: "Breeders who use BreederHQ daily to run their programs. You're reaching someone actively engaged, not a stale listing."

**Rationale**: "Not posting and ghosting" directly addresses a common frustration with classified ads. It's slightly informal but fits the brand voice (human, not corporate).

---

## 5. Services Section Value Proposition

### Headline Options

#### Option A (Recommended)
> "Services from people who get it."

#### Option B
> "Professional services for serious programs."

#### Option C
> "Find providers who understand breeding."

#### Option D
> "Services for breeders and buyers."

**Recommendation**: Option A is warm and confident. "People who get it" implies community knowledge without being exclusionary. Option D (current) is functional but flat.

---

### Description

#### Option A (Recommended)
> "Training, grooming, transport, photography, health testing — from providers who work with breeders regularly. Not general pet services. Specialists who understand your needs."

#### Option B
> "Professional services from providers connected to the breeding community. They know what breeders need because they work with them."

**Rationale**: "Not general pet services" creates contrast. "Specialists who understand your needs" is specific and valuable.

---

### Three Supporting Points

#### Point 1: Breeding-Focused Providers

**Option A (Recommended)**
- **Title**: "Breeding-Focused Providers"
- **Description**: "Reproductive vets, puppy trainers, whelping photographers. Specialists who work with breeders, not generalists."

**Option B**
- **Title**: "Specialist Services"
- **Description**: "Providers who understand breeding timelines, litter needs, and program requirements. Not your average pet service."

---

#### Point 2: Verified Credentials

**Option A (Recommended)**
- **Title**: "Verified Credentials"
- **Description**: "Licensed, insured, reviewed by other breeders. Know who you're hiring before you book."

**Option B**
- **Title**: "Vetted Providers"
- **Description**: "Credentials verified, reviews from real clients. No anonymous listings."

---

#### Point 3: Direct Contact

**Option A (Recommended)**
- **Title**: "Direct Booking"
- **Description**: "Message providers directly. Discuss your needs, get quotes, schedule services. No middlemen."

**Option B**
- **Title**: "Connect Directly"
- **Description**: "Reach out, ask questions, book services. Cut out the back-and-forth."

---

## 6. CTA Section Copy

### Option A (Recommended)

- **Headline**: "Ready to list?"
- **Description**: "Show buyers your full breeding program — not just a listing. Or offer your professional services to the breeding community."
- **CTA 1**: "List Your Program" (for breeders)
- **CTA 2**: "Offer Services" (for service providers)

### Option B

- **Headline**: "Join the marketplace"
- **Description**: "List your breeding program where serious buyers are searching. Or reach breeders and buyers who need professional services."
- **CTA 1**: "List as Breeder"
- **CTA 2**: "List Services Free"

### Option C (Split approach — two separate blocks)

**For Breeders:**
- **Headline**: "Show buyers your real program"
- **Description**: "Not another classified ad. Your complete breeding operation — animals, health records, pedigrees — visible to serious buyers."
- **CTA**: "List Your Program"

**For Service Providers:**
- **Headline**: "Reach the breeding community"
- **Description**: "Breeders need trainers, groomers, transporters, and specialists who understand their work. First year free."
- **CTA**: "List Your Services Free"

**Recommendation**: Option C (split approach) is strongest because breeders and service providers have different motivations. Breeders want qualified buyers; service providers want steady clients. Speaking to each separately is more compelling.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Trust Bar**: Should appear below hero, above any content sections. On cold start, show cold-start copy. Once stats exist, switch to stat display.

2. **Empty States**: Never return `null`. Always show the empty state component with helpful copy and CTAs.

3. **How It Works**: Consider adding this section between Hero and Recent Listings. First-time visitors need context.

4. **Split CTA**: If implementing Option C (split approach), place breeder CTA slightly higher/larger since they're the primary supply side.

5. **Services Section**: The CategorySection with 16 service categories should be rendered. Currently exists in code but not in the return statement.
