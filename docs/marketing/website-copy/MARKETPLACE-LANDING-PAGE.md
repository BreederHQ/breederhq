# Marketplace Landing Page (marketplace.breederhq.com)

**URL**: `marketplace.breederhq.com` (root/homepage)
**Type**: Landing page / front door to marketplace app
**Status**: Draft - New
**Last Updated**: January 2026

---

## Page Purpose

This is NOT a marketing site. This is the front door to the marketplace application. The goal is to:

1. Help visitors quickly understand what this is
2. Route them to the right path (find animals, find services, list services)
3. Get out of the way fast

Design should be clean, simple, and action-oriented. Minimal scrolling. No lengthy feature explanations.

---

## Design Notes

- **No traditional nav menu** — this isn't a marketing site
- **Simple header**: Logo + "Are you a breeder? Manage your program →" link to breederhq.com
- **Hero with search/action cards** — the primary interaction
- **Brief trust signals** — but keep it short
- **Footer**: Minimal (About, Contact, Terms, Privacy, link to breederhq.com)
- **Tone**: Friendly, approachable, casual — this is for everyone, not just professionals

---

## Hero Section

**H1**: Find Your Perfect Match

**Subheadline**: Search breeders, discover services, or list your own — all in one place.

**Alternative H1 options**:
- "Where Animal People Connect"
- "Breeders. Services. All in One Place."
- "Find Breeders and Services Near You"

---

## Primary Action Cards

Three equal-weight cards, side by side (or stacked on mobile):

### Card 1: Find an Animal

**Icon**: Paw print / animal silhouette

**Heading**: Find an Animal

**Description**: Search breeders by species, breed, and location. See health testing, read reviews, and connect directly.

**CTA Button**: Search Breeders

**Placeholder text in search**: "What are you looking for? (e.g., Golden Retriever, Maine Coon, Quarter Horse)"

---

### Card 2: Find Services

**Icon**: Tools / services icon

**Heading**: Find Services

**Description**: Vets, groomers, trainers, photographers, transport, and more. Find animal pros near you.

**CTA Button**: Browse Services

**Placeholder text in search**: "What service do you need? (e.g., mobile grooming, pet transport)"

---

### Card 3: List Your Services

**Icon**: Storefront / listing icon

**Heading**: List Your Services

**Description**: Reach animal owners and breeders who need what you offer. Your first listing is free for a full year.

**CTA Button**: Create Free Listing

**Supporting text**: No credit card required. Upgrade anytime.

---

## Trust Signals Strip

A simple horizontal strip below the cards with quick stats/badges:

- "X breeders listed" (or "Hundreds of breeders" if number is small)
- "X service providers"
- "Dogs, cats, horses, goats, rabbits, sheep"
- "Verified credentials"

Keep this minimal — one line, not a feature list.

---

## Optional: Popular Categories Section

If the page needs more content for SEO, add a section showing popular categories:

**Section Header**: Popular on the Marketplace

**For Animals:**
- Dogs (by popular breeds: Golden Retriever, French Bulldog, German Shepherd, etc.)
- Cats (Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Bengal, etc.)
- Horses (Quarter Horse, Arabian, etc.)

**For Services:**
- Mobile Grooming
- Pet Photography
- Dog Training
- Animal Transport
- Veterinary Services
- Pet Waste Removal

Each category links to filtered search results.

---

## Optional: How It Works (Brief)

If needed for clarity, a simple 3-step explanation:

**For Buyers:**
1. Search by animal type or service
2. Browse profiles and reviews
3. Connect directly with breeders or providers

**For Service Providers:**
1. Create your free listing
2. Add photos, pricing, and service area
3. Start receiving inquiries

Keep this SHORT. Three lines max per path.

---

## Service Provider Callout (Below fold)

For pages that scroll, add a dedicated service provider section:

**Heading**: Got a service? List it free.

**Body**:
Whether you're a mobile groomer, a pet photographer, a dog trainer, or a backyard poop scooper — if you serve animal people, they're looking for you.

Your first listing is free for a full year. No catch. No credit card. Just create your listing and start getting found.

**CTA**: Create Your Free Listing

**Service category examples** (visual grid or list):
- Veterinary & Reproductive Services
- Training & Behavior
- Grooming & Bathing
- Photography & Media
- Transport & Delivery
- Boarding & Daycare
- Waste Removal & Cleanup
- Farrier & Hoof Care
- Shearing & Fiber Services
- Fencing & Farm Services
- Feed & Supplies
- Consulting & Mentorship

---

## Footer

Minimal footer:

**Left side:**
- BreederHQ Marketplace logo
- "Connecting animal people since 2026"

**Links:**
- About
- Contact
- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy

**Right side:**
- "Are you a breeder? Manage your program at breederhq.com →"

---

## SEO Elements

**Title Tag (52 chars):**
BreederHQ Marketplace - Find Breeders & Pet Services

**Meta Description (155 chars):**
Search breeders by breed and location. Find groomers, trainers, vets, and more. List your animal services free for a year. Dogs, cats, horses, and more.

**Primary Keywords:**
- find a breeder
- pet services near me
- animal services marketplace

**Long-tail Keywords:**
- find dog breeders near me
- mobile pet grooming [city]
- pet transport services
- list pet services
- horse breeders [state]
- cat breeders near me

**Schema Markup Considerations:**
- LocalBusiness schema for service providers
- Product schema for animal listings (if applicable)
- Organization schema for BreederHQ

---

## Mobile Considerations

- Cards stack vertically
- Search inputs are prominent and thumb-friendly
- "List Your Services" card should be equally visible (not buried)
- Quick-tap category buttons for common searches

---

## Connection to breederhq.com

The marketplace landing page should include subtle but clear paths back to the main site:

**Header**: "Are you a breeder? Manage your program →" (links to breederhq.com)

**Footer**: Link to breederhq.com

**NOT on this page**:
- Detailed feature explanations (those live on breederhq.com)
- Pricing tiers (those live on breederhq.com)
- SaaS marketing content

The marketplace is the *product*. breederhq.com is where you *learn about* the product.

---

## What This Page Is NOT

- Not a marketing site with multiple pages and nav menus
- Not a feature comparison page
- Not a pricing page
- Not heavily branded/promotional
- Not cluttered with content

This is a **front door**. People should be searching or clicking within 5 seconds of landing.

---

## Content That Lives on breederhq.com Instead

The following detailed content should remain on breederhq.com (the SaaS marketing site):

| Content | URL on breederhq.com | Purpose |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Marketplace for Breeders | /marketplace | Explain marketplace benefits to breeders |
| Service Provider Details | /service-providers | Detailed pitch, pricing tiers, FAQ |
| Buyer Education | /buyers or /marketplace/buyers | How to evaluate breeders, red flags, etc. |

The marketplace landing page links TO these pages for users who want more information, but doesn't duplicate the content.
