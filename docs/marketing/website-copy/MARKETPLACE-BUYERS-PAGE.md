## Section 1: The Challenge of Finding a Good Breeder

Finding a responsible breeder is harder than it should be.

**Common frustrations:**
- **Scam risk** — Online listings often hide puppy mills or outright fraud
- **No verification** — Anyone can claim to health test without proof
- **Scattered information** — Searching across Facebook, Google, and breed club sites
- **Communication chaos** — Inquiries to multiple breeders scattered across email, text, and Messenger
- **No transparency** — Hard to compare breeders or verify their claims

You want a healthy, well-bred animal from someone who knows what they're doing. Finding that person shouldn't require detective work.

### View Breeder Profiles

Every breeder on the marketplace has a public profile showing:

- **About their program** — Philosophy, experience, goals
- **Species and breeds** — What they work with
- **Photos** — Their animals and facilities
- **Verification badges** — Proof of credibility (explained below)
- **Response time** — How quickly they typically reply
- **Available animals and upcoming litters** — What's currently offered

Profiles connect to the breeder's actual BreederHQ data. No fake claims—information comes directly from their breeding records.

---

### Understand Verification Badges

When you see badges on a breeder's profile, here's what they mean:

**Verified Breeder**
This breeder has submitted identity and program documentation. They are who they claim to be.

**Health Testing**
This breeder has uploaded health testing results for their breeding animals. Documentation is on file.

**Quick Responder**
This breeder responds to inquiries within 4 hours during business hours. (Earned automatically based on actual response times—can't be bought.)

**Experienced Breeder**
This breeder has completed 5+ successful placements through BreederHQ. (Earned automatically—can't be bought.)

Badges aren't purchased or applied for. They're earned through documentation and behavior. A breeder with multiple badges has demonstrated commitment to transparency and professionalism.

1. **View their profile** — Read about their program and available animals
2. **Submit an inquiry** — Tell them what you're looking for
3. **Get a response** — Most verified breeders respond within 24 hours
4. **Continue the conversation** — Message back and forth through the platform

## Section 3: What Makes BreederHQ Breeders Different

Not every breeder uses professional breeding management software. Those who do tend to be more serious about their programs.

**BreederHQ breeders typically:**
- Track health testing and genetic data systematically
- Maintain detailed pedigree records
- Use structured waitlist and placement processes
- Communicate professionally with buyers
- Keep documentation organized and accessible

The marketplace doesn't guarantee perfect breeders—you should still do your research. But it connects you with breeders who have invested in professional tools and practices.

## Section 4: Red Flags the Marketplace Helps You Avoid

When searching for a breeder, watch for warning signs. The marketplace structure helps you identify quality:

| Red Flag | How the Marketplace Helps |
|----------|--------------------------|
| No health testing proof | Health Testing badge confirms documentation |
| Won't answer questions | Quick Responder badge shows communication patterns |
| New or unverified identity | Verified Breeder badge confirms legitimacy |
| No track record | Experienced Breeder badge shows placement history |
| Scattered, disorganized communication | Platform keeps everything in one place |
| Claims that can't be verified | Profile data connects to actual breeding records |

The badges don't guarantee a perfect breeder, but they filter out many problematic ones.
