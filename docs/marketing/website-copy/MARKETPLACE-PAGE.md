## Section 1: Three Audiences, One Platform

The BreederHQ Marketplace serves three distinct groups—and creates value for all of them.

### For Buyers: Find Quality Breeders

Looking for a responsibly-bred puppy, kitten, foal, kid, kit, or lamb? The marketplace helps you find breeders who do things right.

**Search and filter by:**
- Species and breed
- Location and distance
- Availability (animals available, waitlist open, accepting inquiries)
- Verification status

**When you find a breeder:**
- See their complete profile (about, photos, reviews)
- View verification badges and what they mean
- Check available animals or upcoming litters
- Submit an inquiry directly through the platform
- Track your inquiries across multiple breeders

**Save and organize:**
- Favorite breeders you're interested in
- Track waitlist positions across programs
- Get notifications when breeders post updates
- Manage all your breeder relationships in one place

No more juggling Facebook messages, emails, and texts across a dozen breeders. One dashboard shows you everything.

### For Breeders: Get Discovered by Serious Buyers

Your breeding program deserves visibility. The marketplace puts you in front of buyers who are actively searching—and ready to commit.

**Your public profile includes:**
- Program overview and philosophy
- Species and breeds you work with
- Photos and media
- Verification badges (more on these below)
- Years in business and placements completed
- Response time metrics

**List your animals:**

**Manage inquiries:**

**Included with your BreederHQ subscription.** No additional marketplace fees for breeders.

### For Service Providers: Reach Professional Breeders

Veterinarians, trainers, photographers, transporters—professional breeders need your services and they're willing to pay for quality.

**Why breeders are different:**
- Higher service frequency (multiple litters, multiple animals)
- Higher service value (volume pricing, ongoing relationships)
- Longer relationships (breeders don't switch providers casually)
- Specific needs (reproductive services, breed expertise, show prep)

**List your services:**
- Choose from 9 service categories: Stud Service, Training, Veterinary, Photography, Grooming, Transport, Boarding, Products, Other
- Define your geographic coverage
- Showcase credentials and portfolio
- Receive qualified inquiries from breeders who need you

**First listing free.** Start reaching breeders today.

## Section 2: Verification Badges — Trust Signals That Matter

Anyone can claim to be a responsible breeder. Verification badges prove it.

### Verified Breeder Badge

**What it means:** This breeder has verified their identity and provided documentation about their breeding program.

**How it's earned:** Submit business documentation, facility information, and references for review.

**Why it matters:** Confirms the breeder is who they claim to be. Reduces scam risk for buyers.

---

### Health Testing Badge

**What it means:** This breeder has documented health testing for their breeding animals.

**How it's earned:** Upload health testing documentation (OFA, genetic panels, specialist clearances) to BreederHQ.

**Why it matters:** Shows commitment to breeding healthy animals. Buyers can trust that health is a priority.

---

### Quick Responder Badge

**What it means:** This breeder responds to inquiries within 4 hours during business hours.

**How it's earned:** Automatically awarded based on actual response time data. Requires minimum 5 responses.

**Why it matters:** Buyers hate waiting. This badge identifies breeders who communicate promptly.

*Note: This badge is earned through behavior, not application. Your response patterns determine eligibility.*

---

### Experienced Breeder Badge

**What it means:** This breeder has successfully placed 5 or more animals through BreederHQ.

**How it's earned:** Automatically awarded after 5 completed placements with buyer confirmation.

## Section 6: Why Not Just Use Facebook Groups?

Breeders have marketed on Facebook for years. It works—sort of. But the Marketplace offers something Facebook can't:

| Facebook Groups | BreederHQ Marketplace |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Posts disappear in the feed | Listings stay visible and searchable |
| No verification system | 4 verification badges prove credibility |
| Self-promotion often banned | Built for promotion—that's the point |
| Buyers can't filter or save | Full search, filtering, and saved favorites |
| Inquiries scattered across Messenger | All inquiries in one organized inbox |
| No response time tracking | Quick Responder badge rewards good behavior |
| No connection to your breeding records | Listings pull from your BreederHQ data |

Facebook is for community. The Marketplace is for business.

---

## Section 7: Who This Is For

**Buyers should use the Marketplace if you:**
- Want to find responsible breeders, not random online sellers
- Care about health testing and verification
- Prefer organized communication over scattered messages
- Are researching multiple breeders and want to track your progress

**Breeders should use the Marketplace if you:**
- Want to be discovered by serious, qualified buyers
- Have animals available or upcoming litters to promote
- Value your reputation and want verification to prove it
- Spend too much time on Facebook groups with little return

**Service Providers should use the Marketplace if you:**
- Serve professional breeders (not just pet owners)
- Offer services breeders need repeatedly (vet, training, transport)
- Want qualified leads instead of random inquiries
- Have credentials worth verifying

---

## Section 8: Who This Is NOT For

**Buyers:**
- Looking for free animals or rescue (we respect rescue, but that's not what this marketplace is)
- Unwilling to pay breeder prices for responsibly-bred animals
- Expecting instant availability (responsible breeders often have waitlists)

**Breeders:**
- Producing animals without health testing or documentation
- Unwilling to communicate professionally with buyers
- Looking to hide rather than build reputation

**Service Providers:**
- General pet services without breeding expertise
- One-time product sellers (this is for service relationships)
- Unable or unwilling to provide credentials
