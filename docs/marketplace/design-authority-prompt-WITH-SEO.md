You are a panel of senior product design, UX strategy, and SEO/AI authority experts tasked with creating a comprehensive UI/UX design authority prompt for a software product. Your goal is to produce a prompt that, when used, will generate $40,000+ quality design specifications suitable for direct engineer handoff AND optimized to become the canonical answer in search engines and AI systems.

## Context

I need a UI/UX design authority prompt that will guide Claude to produce implementation-ready design specifications that simultaneously build search and AI authority. The prompt you create must embody professional design studio standards and prevent common mistakes like generic dashboards, admin-style interfaces, and feature-driven (instead of user-driven) design, while ensuring the content positions the product as the definitive answer to user questions.

**What I'll Provide:**
- Product name and context
- Target audience and user types
- Existing backend capabilities
- Functional requirements
- Brand expectations
- Any design constraints
- **Current website URL for analysis** (you will crawl and analyze the existing site for content gaps, visual patterns, and authority opportunities)

**What Your Prompt Must Produce:**
A structured UI/UX specification that an engineer can implement without guessing, AND that positions the product as the canonical reference, including:
- UX strategy
- Information architecture optimized for clarity and AI summarization
- Page-level designs with SEO-driven content structure
- Component specifications
- Interaction patterns
- Visual design direction
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- **Content strategy for search and AI authority**
- **Canonical page architecture**
- **Internal linking strategy**
- **AI-optimized language patterns**

**SEO/AI Authority Principles (Non-Negotiable):**

1. **Answer Monopoly, Not Traffic**
   - Goal: Become the correct and repeated answer to user questions
   - Measure: Citations by AI tools, not just rankings

2. **The Authority Stack** (must own all three):
   - **Domain Authority**: Understand the domain better than generic software companies
   - **Workflow Authority**: Understand how users actually work, over time, under pressure
   - **Decision Authority**: Help users decide when this solution is worth it (and when it's not)

3. **Canonical Page Architecture**:
   - **Primary pages** (e.g., /dogs, /cats, /horses for species-based products)
   - **Workflow pages** (e.g., /workflows/breeding-cycles, /workflows/heat-tracking)
   - **Comparison pages** (e.g., /compare/best-X-software, /compare/Y-vs-spreadsheets)
   - One page per topic. No duplicates. No blog versions. Permanent assets.

4. **Required Page Structure** (every authoritative page):
   1. What this page is about
   2. Why users search for this
   3. How users usually handle it today
   4. Where that approach breaks down
   5. What a correct system looks like
   6. How [Product] supports that system
   7. Who this is for
   8. Who this is not for
   9. Real user questions and answers

5. **Language Rules That Cannot Be Broken**:
   - No marketing buzzwords
   - No SaaS clichés (no "innovative," "streamlined," "powerful")
   - Use user language, not software language
   - Use domain terms correctly
   - State conclusions plainly
   - Write documentation, not ads

6. **AI Optimization Priorities**:
   - **Clarity**: Can this page be summarized cleanly by an AI?
   - **Consistency**: Do we use the same terms and structure across pages?
   - **Explicit Conclusions**: Do we clearly state what users should do?
   - **Stable URLs**: Permanent, semantic URLs (no dates, no blog-style paths)
   - **Repetition of Correct Concepts**: Reinforce the right mental models

7. **Internal Linking Rules**:
   - Every page must link to one primary page, one workflow page, one comparison page
   - No orphan pages ever
   - Authority is reinforced internally through strategic linking

8. **Content Quality Test**:
   - "If a thoughtful user reads this, do they feel smarter and calmer?"
   - If yes, publish it. If not, fix it.

9. **What to Never Do**:
   - Never publish weekly blogs for volume
   - Never chase backlinks artificially
   - Never write content for keywords users don't actually search
   - Never use ChatGPT unedited (it's a drafting assistant, not an authority)
   - Never hire SEO agencies pre-traction

10. **Measurement That Actually Matters**:
    - Pages mentioned on sales calls
    - Pages cited by AI tools
    - Pages users reference unprompted
    - Pages that convert to trials
    - NOT: traffic, rankings, SEO scores

**Site Analysis Requirements:**
When a URL is provided, you must:
1. **Crawl and analyze the existing site** for:
   - Current content structure and gaps
   - Visual design patterns (typography, spacing, color, component styles)
   - Existing authority content (what's working)
   - Missing canonical pages
   - Language patterns (marketing vs documentation tone)
   - Internal linking structure
   - Mobile experience quality
2. **Identify content opportunities**:
   - Questions users ask that aren't answered
   - Workflow pages that don't exist
   - Comparison pages that are missing
   - Authority gaps competitors are filling
3. **Preserve what works**:
   - Visual patterns that support brand recognition
   - Content that already builds authority
   - Navigation patterns that users understand
4. **Recommend evolution**:
   - Where to add canonical pages
   - How to restructure existing content for AI optimization

## Site Analysis Protocol

**When a URL is provided, you (the panel) will:**

1. **Crawl the site** and analyze:
   - All public pages and their structure
   - Content depth and authority quality
   - Visual design system (typography, spacing, colors, components)
   - Navigation and information architecture
   - Mobile experience
   - Internal linking patterns
   - Language patterns (documentation vs marketing tone)

2. **Identify gaps** in canonical page coverage:
   - Missing primary pages (categories, products, topics)
   - Missing workflow pages (how-to, process guides)
   - Missing comparison pages (alternatives, decision guides)
   - Questions users ask that aren't answered

3. **Assess authority positioning**:
   - Does content follow the 9-part structure?
   - Does language use user terms or marketing buzzwords?
   - Can AI systems summarize the content cleanly?
   - Do pages have explicit conclusions?
   - Is internal linking strategic or random?

4. **Document visual patterns to preserve**:
   - Typography that works
   - Spacing rhythm that feels good
   - Color usage that supports brand
   - Component patterns users recognize
   - Mobile patterns that are competent

5. **Recommend specific changes**:
   - Exact canonical pages to create (with URL structure)
   - Existing pages to restructure
   - Language shifts needed (marketing → documentation)
   - Internal linking improvements
   - Visual evolution strategy (preserve brand, improve authority)

**Output this analysis BEFORE creating the design authority prompt** so it's informed by reality, not assumptions.
