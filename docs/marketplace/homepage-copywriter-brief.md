# Copywriter Brief: Marketplace Homepage Content

**Project**: BreederHQ Marketplace Homepage
**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Deliverable**: UI copy for empty states, trust elements, and explanatory sections

---

## Context

BreederHQ is a professional marketplace connecting animal buyers with verified breeders and service providers. Unlike classified ad sites (Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace), BreederHQ breeders use the platform to manage their entire breeding program - animals, health records, pedigrees, and litters.

**Brand Voice**:
- Professional but warm (not corporate)
- Trustworthy and transparent
- Confident without being salesy
- Human-focused (about relationships, not just transactions)

**NOT**:
- Cutesy pet language ("furbabies", "pawsome")
- Generic SaaS speak ("unlock", "supercharge", "leverage")
- Aggressive sales copy
- Corporate jargon

**Target Audiences**:
1. **Buyers** - Looking for a puppy, kitten, horse, etc. from a reputable breeder
2. **Breeders** - Professional breeders who want to reach qualified buyers
3. **Service Providers** - Trainers, groomers, transporters, etc.

## Deliverables Needed

### 1. Trust Bar Copy

The trust bar appears below the hero and shows aggregate marketplace statistics. We need copy for two scenarios:

**Scenario A: Cold Start (No Stats)**
When marketplace has zero or very few listings, we can't show numbers. Need messaging that builds credibility without specific stats.

Current placeholder:
> "New marketplace · Verified breeders joining daily"

**Provide 2-3 alternatives** that:
- Acknowledge the marketplace is new
- Build confidence that quality breeders are coming
- Don't feel desperate or apologetic
- Approximately 8-12 words

**Scenario B: With Stats**
When we have data, we show formatted numbers. Need the labels.

Current:
- "[X]+ Verified Breeders"
- "[X]+ Animals Listed"
- "[X]+ Reviews"

**Are these labels optimal?** Provide alternatives if you think they could be improved. Consider:
- "Verified Breeders" vs "Active Breeders" vs "Breeding Programs"
- "Animals Listed" vs "Available Animals" vs "Listings"
- Should we say "Reviews" or "Buyer Reviews" or "Verified Reviews"?

---

### 2. Empty State Copy

When sections have no content (cold-start marketplace), we show empty states instead of hiding sections. Need compelling copy for three scenarios:

#### Empty State: No Listings

**Context**: The "Recent Listings" section has no animals to display.

**Current copy**:
- Title: "New animals coming soon"
- Description: "Breeders are setting up their programs. Check back soon or browse our verified breeders."
- Primary CTA: "Browse Breeders"
- Secondary CTA: "List Your Animals"

**Provide improved versions** that:
- Feel helpful, not apologetic
- Give the user something actionable to do
- Approximately 5-8 words for title
- Approximately 15-25 words for description

#### Empty State: No Breeders

**Context**: The "Breeders" section has no breeders to display.

**Current copy**:
- Title: "Breeders are joining"
- Description: "Our marketplace is growing. Be among the first to connect with verified breeding programs."
- Primary CTA: "Get Notified"
- Secondary CTA: "Join as a Breeder"

**Provide improved versions** with same constraints as above.

#### Empty State: No Services

**Context**: The "Services" section has no service providers to display.

**Current copy**:
- Title: "Services launching soon"
- Description: "Professional animal services are being added. Interested in offering your services?"
- Primary CTA: "Learn More"
- Secondary CTA: "Offer Your Services"

**Provide improved versions** with same constraints as above.

### 3. "How It Works" Section Copy

A three-step explainer for first-time visitors who don't understand how BreederHQ is different from classified ads.

**Current copy** (needs review/improvement):

**Step 1: Browse programs**
> "Search by breed, location, or species. See full breeding programs, not just listings."

**Step 2: Review credentials**
> "Check health testing, breeding history, and program details before you reach out."

**Step 3: Connect directly**
> "Message breeders through the platform. Ask questions, request info, schedule visits."

**Provide improved versions** that:
- Are action-oriented (verbs in titles)
- Differentiate from classified ads
- Are scannable (short phrases)
- Title: 2-4 words
- Description: 12-20 words

**Consider alternative step structures** if you think a different 3-step flow would be clearer:
- Current: Browse → Review → Connect
- Alternative: Search → Verify → Contact?
- Alternative: Find → Trust → Connect?

### 4. Main Value Proposition Section

This section explains why BreederHQ is different. Currently titled "Not a classified ad. A breeding program."

**Current copy**:
> "BreederHQ breeders use our platform to manage their entire program - animals, health records, pedigrees, litters. What you see here is their real operation, not a one-off listing."

**Three supporting points**:
1. **Full Program Visibility**
   > "See their animals, breeding history, health testing, and past litters - not just one listing."

2. **Direct Connection**
   > "Message breeders directly. Ask questions, request more info, schedule visits."

3. **Established Programs**
   > "Breeders actively managing their animals, health records, and breeding plans on our platform."

**Review and improve** this copy:
- Is "Not a classified ad. A breeding program." the strongest headline?
- Are the three points the right differentiators?
- Is the description clear and compelling?
- Provide 2-3 alternative headline options

### 5. Services Section Value Proposition

Similar section for the services marketplace.

**Current headline**: "Services for breeders and buyers."

**Current description**:
> "Find professional services to support your animals - from training and grooming to transport and health testing. All from providers who understand the breeding community."

**Three supporting points**:
1. **Professional Services**
   > "Training, grooming, transport, photography, and more from verified providers."

2. **Vetted Providers**
   > "Service providers connected to the breeding community, not random listings."

3. **Direct Booking**
   > "Contact providers directly to discuss your needs and schedule services."

**Review and improve** this copy:
- Is the headline compelling?
- Do the three points communicate value?
- Provide 2-3 alternative headline options

### 6. Service Provider Recruitment Section (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem**: The current homepage does NOTHING to encourage service providers to list. A trainer, groomer, or transport company visiting the site sees a breeder marketplace with no reason to join.

**Context**: BreederHQ supports 16+ service categories:
- Training (obedience, specialty, behavioral)
- Grooming
- Boarding & Day Care
- Transport & Shipping
- Photography & Videography
- Veterinary & Health Testing
- Stud Services
- Whelping/Breeding Assistance
- Working Dog Training (herding, hunting, protection)
- Livestock Services (shearing, farrier)
- And more...

**Key differentiator**: Unlike Rover (20% fee) and Wag (40% fee), BreederHQ charges NO transaction fees. Providers keep 100% of what they charge.

**Target audience**: Professional service providers — trainers, groomers, transporters, photographers, vets, farriers, shearers, etc.

**Provide copy for**:

1. **Section Headline** (5-10 words)
   - Current placeholder: "Offer your services to the breeding community"
   - Should speak TO providers, not ABOUT them
   - Provide 2-3 alternatives

2. **Section Description** (20-30 words)
   - Current placeholder: "Trainers, groomers, transporters, photographers, vets — breeders and buyers need your expertise. List your services and connect with clients who understand the value of professional animal care."
   - Should answer: "Why should I list here?"
   - Provide 2-3 alternatives

3. **Three Value Propositions** (title ~3-5 words + description ~15-20 words each)

   Current placeholders:
   - "Reach the right clients" / "Connect with serious breeders and pet owners who value quality over price."
   - "No platform fees" / "Direct contact with clients. No commissions, no middleman fees on bookings."
   - "Build your reputation" / "Collect reviews, showcase your credentials, and stand out in your specialty."

   **Questions**:
   - Are these the right three selling points?
   - Is "No platform fees" strong enough? (This is a MAJOR differentiator)
   - What else matters to service providers?

4. **CTA Button Text**
   - Current: "List Your Services"
   - Alternatives? ("Get Listed", "Join as Provider", "Start Listing", etc.)

---

### 7. Breeder CTA Section Copy

Separate CTA specifically for breeders (distinct from service providers).

**Current copy**:
- Headline: "Join the BreederHQ Marketplace"
- Description: "List your breeding program, animals, or professional services. Reach qualified buyers actively searching for what you offer."
- CTA: "List as Breeder"

**Problems**:
- Too generic — lumps breeders and service providers together
- Doesn't explain why a breeder should list HERE vs elsewhere

**Provide improved versions**:

1. **Headline** (5-10 words)
   - Current: "Join the BreederHQ Marketplace"
   - Should speak specifically to breeders
   - Provide 2-3 alternatives

2. **Description** (20-30 words)
   - Should answer: "Why list my breeding program here?"
   - Key point: Breeders already use BreederHQ to manage their program — marketplace is an extension
   - Provide 2-3 alternatives

3. **CTA Button Text**
   - Current: "List as Breeder"
   - Alternatives? ("Show Your Program", "Get Listed", "Join as Breeder", etc.)
